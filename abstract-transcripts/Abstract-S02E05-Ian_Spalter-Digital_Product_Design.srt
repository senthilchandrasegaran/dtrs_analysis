1
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:18,560
A big part of how humanity
experiences the universe is visual.

2
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:24,691
You carry around this device with you
that allows you to capture

3
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,651
what you're seeing in a moment in time,

4
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:30,488
and then send it
anywhere and everywhere on Earth.

5
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,451
You have this magic piece of glass

6
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,870
that creates
these very transformational experiences

7
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,289
that can teleport you to a place and time.

8
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,710
It's a way of bringing things
that are far away closer.

9
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,590
It's pretty powerful how that's evolved

10
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,384
in a fairly short amount of time
in human history.

11
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,979
I don't think anyone
could've anticipated

12
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,273
how successful Instagram would’ve been.

13
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,401
It's hands down
one of the most influential technologies.

14
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,988
Instagram announcing
that it now has over 400 million...

15
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,616
One billion
monthly active users.

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,872
Ian Spalter is a big name here
in Silicon Valley.

17
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:24,876
One in seven people on the planet
are using a product that Ian oversees.

18
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,377
That's astonishing.

19
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,632
I can't imagine Instagram
without Ian.

20
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,175
His infatuation with craft

21
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,011
let me know that he was going to be
the person to lead design.

22
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,847
The nature of Silicon Valley
is iterating,

23
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,809
is seeing what's next,
is looking at what's new.

24
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,619
Design is everywhere.

25
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,251
There's nothing that you use
that isn't designed in some way.

26
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,214
Their designed to help you complete
a given task.

27
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,636
It's just a matter
of how well designed it is or not.

28
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,850
A design isn't just what it looks like
in a given moment.

29
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:26,479
It has to do with the entire experience
of using a particular product or service.

30
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,941
The easiest way
to talk about user experience

31
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,609
is in combination with UI.

32
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,903
UI stands for user interface.

33
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,323
Those are just the visual
and physical elements

34
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,034
that a person interacts with
when using a device.

35
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,037
UX stands for user experience.

36
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:48,084
And that is literally the experience
a person has while using a user interface.

37
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,921
Those feelings can be emotions
like happiness

38
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,507
or frustration and everything in between.

39
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,887
Your stove has a UI.

40
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,432
So what conventions
are out there in the world

41
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,933
that you should take advantage of?

42
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,436
You don't want someone to think
too much about heating a pan.

43
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,025
But then, sometimes
there are opportunities to improve things.

44
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,029
Maybe it's about adding options
that make sense.

45
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,322
So, I have a toaster

46
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,241
that has a button
that says "A bit more" on it.

47
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,203
It literally says, "A bit more."

48
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,622
Totally get why
you would need that, right?

49
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,042
'Cause that's... that's part of
the user experience of making toast.

50
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:35,506
Now, as a designer, there are costs to
that, because now you added a new button.

51
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,467
Is it worth it? Is it actually valuable?

52
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,595
Is it something that people use,
or is it just sort of superfluous,

53
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,056
you know, and just, like,
maybe sell some toasters.

54
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,061
That's all part of the experience,
thinking about the conditions

55
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,312
and the context.

56
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,941
And then how do you work
within those constraints to make that task

57
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,652
as easy and pleasurable as possible?

58
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,322
- Have a good day.
- See you in a hundred years.

59
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,490
A hundred years?

60
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,372
Instagram is a product used
by a billion people every month,

61
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,791
and we've been around for eight years.

62
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,543
Being at the center
of so many connections and memories

63
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,214
really adds
to the sense of responsibility we have.

64
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,510
Instagram is a social place that you go
to share photos and see photos of friends.

65
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,178
- Hi, everybody.
- Everyone...

66
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,723
Hey, guys. I feel like it's been a while
since I've actually spoken on here.

67
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,601
But I think
that our identities today

68
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,729
are increasingly mediated
through our devices.

69
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,939
And if you're a business,

70
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,941
or if you're a brand,
or you're a celebrity,

71
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:38,278
a lot of your identity is bound up
with your Instagram.

72
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,156
Instagram's all about showcasing
the things that other people are creating.

73
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,284
And so our job as designers,
in a lot of ways,

74
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,370
is to give them the tools they need
to express themselves

75
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,871
and then get out of the way.

76
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,209
The app isn't just about content,

77
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,212
it's actually about, like,
forming strong relationships with

78
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,296
the people that you're connected to
on the platform

79
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,092
as well as the things
that you're most interested in.

80
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,054
We're pretty rigorous about
thinking through

81
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,057
how I use Instagram
versus how you might use Instagram.

82
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,600
Eugene, do you love us?

83
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:13,104
Imagine being in charge of
implementing change for a billion people,

84
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,231
including really powerful people.

85
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,650
Like, I can't imagine
the weight that that is.

86
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,446
I think it's important to understand
that this field,

87
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,532
call it product design,
UX design, UI design,

88
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,700
is really young,

89
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:30,413
and it's also an amalgamation of lots
of things that have come before it.

90
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,167
A computer is a
lifeless, mindless collection of hardware,

91
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,878
but it can be given life of a kind.

92
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,297
In the early days of computing,

93
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,175
you had people
thinking about human factors,

94
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,219
thinking about what it means
for a human to use tools.

95
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,931
Computers were
these giant mainframes.

96
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:53,603
One K of memory might come in,
like, on a cart with dry ice.

97
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,189
And too, you'd have to hold down,
like, a button

98
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,712
and then tap it with your nose
to, like, make it work, like...

99
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,778
that wasn't... that wasn't hyperbole,
that's just how it was.

100
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,655
People who were designing
the first operating systems,

101
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,784
the first bits of software,
were coming from research backgrounds

102
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,161
with an expertise in human factors.

103
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,082
Trying to understand
people and machines

104
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,626
and what are the different things
you need to consider?

105
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,462
Extensive user tests
have shown that a user

106
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,340
can learn how to use
a Lisa application in 22 minutes.

107
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,050
By simply using the mouse,

108
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,845
the user can move an arrow around
on the screen and simply point.

109
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,765
My father was Jef Raskin,

110
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:34,185
the guy who created
the Macintosh Project at Apple.

111
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,271
Jef introduced the idea of click and drag,

112
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,795
which now seems so obvious
in retrospect that you would, like,

113
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,984
point to something, click, and move it.

114
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,529
But that as a gesture didn't exist.

115
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,824
You had companies like Apple
trying to bring together liberal arts,

116
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,035
so people who are amazing graphic artists,

117
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,122
like Susan Kare, who could come in
and design icons.

118
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,626
This is a new medium that offers
great control turning off.

119
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,879
There's thousands of little dots in...

120
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,090
And then you kind of fast forward
a bit to, say,

121
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,426
- the early days of the web...
- You've got mail!

122
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,429
And the understanding of what
was expected of designers

123
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,889
was not just media designers
or graphic designers,

124
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,393
but you actually had these titles like
"information architect,"

125
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,645
because the web
was about information,

126
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,730
and you had to think
about how you present that.

127
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,232
Goodbye.

128
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,112
Back in college, the consumer internet
was just getting started.

129
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,534
College campuses were
some of the first places to have access.

130
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,454
So, the way to get access to that was to
go to the computer lab

131
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,164
and stay there as long as possible.

132
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,807
For me, that was staying there
until three o'clock in the morning

133
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,168
on a regular basis,

134
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,879
just playing with stuff
and exploring design.

135
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,631
And so I actually created
my first website.

136
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,885
Both great and awful, I'd say.

137
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,968
Um...

138
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,638
- What was the site for?
- What was it for?

139
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,391
I mean, just to say,
"I know how to build a website," I guess.

140
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,145
- There it is.
- It's pretty awesome. And awful.

141
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,900
Ian Spalter is somebody who
incorporates design

142
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:08,988
into every level of the business process,
of the creative process,

143
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,282
and the product process.

144
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,078
The work that Ian did on the FuelBand
was a hugely important milestone.

145
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,499
The FuelBand was Nike's take
on the fitness tracker,

146
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,752
and it was arguably
the most compelling take

147
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,962
when it launched in the beginning of 2012.

148
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,342
Nike was interested in
helping everyone become more active.

149
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,010
And it was a project

150
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,430
that was based around a new piece
of hardware that was being developed.

151
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,767
And this hardware was going to be
essentially like a pedometer.

152
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,062
And at this time, pedometers
were like this Scarlet Letter thing.

153
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,980
It wasn't something you wanted to wear.

154
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,776
And so what we wanted to do
is set out to make it fun,

155
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,503
and it would have the Nike stamp on it,

156
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,756
so it would be something
you'd want to wear all the time.

157
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,620
We worked across everything
from thinking about

158
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,493
how you configure this thing and set it up

159
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,828
to the actual visual brand,

160
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,748
what it looked like
from the app standpoint or on the web.

161
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,043
And the FuelBand
was one of the first activity trackers

162
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,711
to implement goal-setting,

163
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,507
individual feedback that would show how
you were progressing towards that goal.

164
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,219
And you get that immediate reward.

165
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,597
One of the things that
Ian and his team were able to do

166
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,432
that nobody else did at the time

167
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:22,812
was they created a system that allowed
people to improve their habits.

168
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,439
The idea
of tracking your progress

169
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,150
was really within
the domain of elite athletes.

170
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,445
So, Nike Plus was the first time
that the quantified self

171
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,698
really became a mainstream idea.

172
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:38,119
The FuelBand really helped create
the market that Apple went on to dominate.

173
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,038
The DNA made its way into the Apple Watch,

174
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,624
and it's how people use the devices
in their daily lives.

175
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,460
We had a lot of fun with,
like, making this fun.

176
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,904
Personally, I'm really proud of it

177
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,132
because it's something that
my parents ended up actually using.

178
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,969
And it's something that...
a product they found really valuable

179
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,389
in terms of helping them...
become more healthy.

180
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,225
And also for them to understand
what I actually did every day.

181
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,311
It still works.

182
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:07,815
Yeah, when ours died, we went out
and got replacements on eBay.

183
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,485
One of the things that
we used to give Ian for his birthday

184
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,530
was just a blank, black bound book

185
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,574
and put the year in.

186
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,326
And he loved it.

187
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,328
So, he used to draw all the time.

188
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,080
And my brother used to say,
"Look at that forehead!

189
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,041
He's gonna be brilliant!"

190
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,002
- "He's gonna be a genius."
- "He's gonna be a genius!" Yeah.

191
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,339
Because he has like a...
We call it a five head, you know?

192
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,383
And so, he was right.

193
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,015
When I start a new project, the
first thing I do is to define the problem,

194
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,311
to understand the "why"
of what we're trying to do

195
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,897
and what is the thing
we're trying to solve for?

196
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,275
Travel back in time a little bit
to around...

197
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,027
I think it was after iOS 7.

198
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,739
Pretty much every application
had flattened out their app icon.

199
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:00,201
Instagram did not. They wanted to do it
for the right reasons.

200
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,538
Turns out that right reason was me
showing up to actually take it on!

201
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,165
My first reaction was, like, "No!"

202
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:10,711
But Instagram knew that it had
already evolved from where it started

203
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,881
and it was time to signal
that change was coming.

204
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,260
Ian's first projects
were to redesign the app,

205
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,346
make it more modern,

206
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,723
and redesign our logo.

207
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:27,061
I want to be really clear on something.
I hated both of these projects.

208
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,729
I didn't want them to happen.

209
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,691
I designed the original logo.
I designed the original app.

210
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,486
He was like, "We're gonna need a room,
and we're gonna need to hole up,

211
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,280
and you're not gonna see anything
from us for three months."

212
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,658
And I'm like, "Can't do that.

213
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,285
We need results. How about a week?"

214
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,663
The first step was

215
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,958
looking at what existed at that moment.

216
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,670
It's this very round shape,

217
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,340
it's got these very candy-like features
in the lens.

218
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,176
And the color is almost brown like...

219
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,303
like a teddy bear or something, you know?

220
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,307
Then on top of the teddy bear,
you got a rainbow.

221
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,932
It's like, what's not to love?

222
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,560
How do you go beyond that?

223
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,312
Where do you...
What's important about this?

224
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,565
What is actually essential?

225
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,194
I remember
they blacked out the windows.

226
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,363
They say that was because

227
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,365
they wanted the mood to be right.

228
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,326
I'm pretty sure they just didn't want me
seeing what they were doing.

229
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,829
So, an exercise I did
was I just had everyone

230
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,290
in our kind of weekly company meeting,

231
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,834
and I said, "All right, everyone,
you have ten seconds

232
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:36,046
to draw the existing Instagram logo
from memory. Go."

233
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,423
So, everyone kind of...

234
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,800
That, maybe they put the top hat in there.

235
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,428
And then they got the... Whatever, right?

236
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,097
What was interesting
is the range of stuff you got.

237
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,058
And you get some fun things
that look like keyholes,

238
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,103
and, you know, fried eggs.

239
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,481
And, like, a whole range of stuff.

240
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,649
But it was helpful for us as input

241
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,444
to understand, "Wait, actually,
like, this rainbow thing

242
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,887
is starting to pop through in it."

243
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,032
Like, we kind of knew that this top
section was gonna be important.

244
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:07,077
We knew that the, um... the actual lens
was gonna be important.

245
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,246
But the rainbow popped out
as something that

246
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,624
was really baked into people's memory.

247
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,002
You look at some of our early evolutions,
like, we kind of started here,

248
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,464
just kind of flattening out
the existing app icon.

249
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,510
And we just felt like we were
just creating bootlegs of...

250
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,679
of what existed,
and weren't getting somewhere better.

251
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,724
And then you start to see us getting
back down to basics

252
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,227
and figuring out
what's the actual shape of this thing?

253
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,605
You kind of scan to look for something
that's just interesting,

254
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,148
um, that stays with you,

255
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,151
that looks beyond just, like,
a bunch of shapes thrown together.

256
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,820
This is, like, upside down.

257
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,489
This one's funny.

258
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,241
That's it.

259
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,369
But you make a lot of bad stuff.

260
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,371
And that's just...
That's part of the process.

261
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,623
I remember walking in,

262
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,875
and the walls are just...

263
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,588
plastered with every variant of logo
you could possibly imagine.

264
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,924
We knew that this rainbow bit

265
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,219
was a part of the existing app icon.

266
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:09,098
And so this idea of having multiple colors

267
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,725
came from that,
and kind of started sampling colors.

268
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,271
Started playing with, "Okay, what if we
don't just go with one solid color?

269
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,274
What if we... What if we
actually start to blend colors?"

270
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,651
I think, at first, I was gravitating
towards this guy,

271
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,821
who was kind of a cute little,
you know, raccoon-looking thing.

272
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,823
When we applied color to it, though,

273
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,825
it also was pretty educational,

274
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,870
because now you've got
these more complicated shapes

275
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,872
on a way more complicated background

276
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,666
and they kind of fight
or just do too much,

277
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,043
where the balance between having
a really simple form

278
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,170
with a lot of color felt better.

279
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,231
I probably remember
everything that happened that day.

280
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,484
I remember being in a dark
conference room at the end of the day

281
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,988
with a bottle of tequila, probably.

282
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,991
I was like, "You guys spent three months

283
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,201
showing me a square in a circle?"

284
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,285
You know?

285
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,080
Then there was...
I think it was an Adweek article.

286
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,541
It was, like,
"The worst design decision ever."

287
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,501
And Ian was like, "It's okay."

288
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:23,881
You had the world saying one thing,
then your gut telling you something else.

289
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,760
You learn pretty fast
how quick Internet trolls work

290
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,511
when you launch something like this.

291
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,514
There was this gif of, this kid

292
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,433
who was, like... like, has a mullet,

293
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,685
and he's doing stuff on the computer.

294
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,313
And it always ends with him,
like, putting a thumbs up.

295
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,942
And they were kind of jabbing at us
for doing the gradient

296
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,611
as if it was like a simple gradient.

297
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,948
But at the end of that, it stuck.

298
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,076
And can you imagine Instagram
in any other way today?

299
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,328
Talk about change
and people not liking change,

300
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,830
but, in a matter of a few years,
it's gone from

301
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,250
a couple hundred million people
to over a billion.

302
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,921
And that is a huge testament
to the work that he's done there.

303
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,257
So, in addition
to simplifying the app icon,

304
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,009
they also simplified the app itself.

305
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,719
Ian came in
and stripped everything down.

306
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,806
Took out all the color,
made everything a lot simpler-looking.

307
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,891
And the big effect that had
was it made the photos

308
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,601
the center of the user experience.

309
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,730
If I can't go to your app

310
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,274
and in five seconds know what to do,
you've got a big problem.

311
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,486
That's the power of really good UX.

312
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:32,282
Because computing has become
so much more physical, in a way,

313
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,451
it's like you're actually touching things.

314
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:39,373
The real world, the physical world,
has gravity.

315
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,667
It has momentum.

316
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,213
And so the expectations of how things
should be able to respond

317
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:50,426
to you taking actions on these screens,
it's different now.

318
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,095
It's a higher level of expectation.
How should it feel?

319
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,015
What should the feedback be?
How quickly should it move?

320
00:16:56,098 --> 00:17:00,102
There's a lot of these nuances in moments
between the main moments.

321
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,023
You think about any sort of transition
that you see in our app today,

322
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,234
like, maybe it's the cube transition
on stories.

323
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,070
Like, why is that important?
You could have just, like, cut.

324
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,035
When you're watching a film, right,
like, what does that...

325
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,996
Hard cuts versus a... a wipe or a fade,

326
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,708
that kind of changes
the emotional quality of that film.

327
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:27,212
So getting that feel right is something
that we really place a high premium on.

328
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,926
And so there's a whole team of people
to think about those things

329
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,222
and make decisions to try to make that
as great an experience as possible.

330
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,643
We call our designers
"product designers,"

331
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,230
and the reason why we have
that definition is because

332
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,274
it's not even just about
the user experience.

333
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,194
It's also about
the overall product strategy.

334
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,739
What we are putting out there
is a product.

335
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:57,326
And so it helps kind of orient people
on what's expected of them.

336
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,287
- And some celebratory moments.
- Yeah.

337
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,915
- Is that something?
- Yeah. We actually have it.

338
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,375
We never want a feature
to feel overwhelming

339
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,796
or look like we spent years on this.

340
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,549
And there's, like, massive features
and so many buttons and...

341
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,803
That's very important to us,
to make sure the app is simple.

342
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,013
This group
is fairly distinctive in that

343
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,474
we don't just think about
frozen moments in time

344
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,557
and, like, layouts.

345
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,853
They're also thinking about how things
move and connect and flow.

346
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,272
A big maze of...

347
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,774
This is...

348
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,776
This is insane, man.

349
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,529
One of the things that I love about
this prototype,

350
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,906
it's really satisfying to watch type...

351
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,950
type in, you know?

352
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,160
- Can you put that on here?
- Yeah. Here.

353
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,412
- Should I put it in?
- I'll just AirDrop it.

354
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,375
Designers here tend to prototype
at very high fidelities,

355
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,628
because it gives us a better idea
of what the end experience is.

356
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,672
We know that you can't really
experience a design

357
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,423
when it's just flat pixels on a screen.

358
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,301
No one, you know, uses products like that.

359
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,971
They use things
that they actually have to tap and use.

360
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,476
Cool. So, today
we're gonna talk about

361
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,437
some of the profile work
that we've kicked off in H-Two,

362
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,649
um, that we're referring to
as "Profile Neue."

363
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,360
We have a team working on Profile.

364
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,697
And Profile is a cornerstone of Instagram.

365
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,159
It's kind of a space of co-ownership
between people making the app

366
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,369
and the actual members of that community.

367
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,497
A profile is the representation
of that person.

368
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,000
And so it's a tricky project
for that reason.

369
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,253
Profile as a surface is starting to break.

370
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:36,258
When you add new features over time,
things get more complicated

371
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,219
and the design
becomes less and less elegant.

372
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,638
And so we want to take a step back

373
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,349
to make sure that its purpose is clear.

374
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,853
A redesign,
getting it right is very important,

375
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,063
especially if you have a loved product.

376
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,859
You have all these famous examples
throughout social media history

377
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:57,654
of redesigns and product decisions that
have gone well and that haven't gone well.

378
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,615
Snapchat's redesign did not go well.

379
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,367
Snapchat is facing
a wave of pushback from its users...

380
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,704
complaining the redesign
is confusing and harder to use.

381
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,789
A single tweet
from the reality star

382
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,193
did not help the company's stock.

383
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,084
In the hours
following her tweet,

384
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,462
shares fell
more than six percent Thursday,

385
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,465
wiping out more than
a billion dollars in value.

386
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,636
Some of the problems we see
with Instagram Profile is that

387
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,698
in the past couple years, we've added
a lot more different types of content.

388
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,683
So, we've got story highlights,
stories, IGTV,

389
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:30,187
different actions for ways to get
a little bit more connected to businesses.

390
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,899
So it's kind of just been a little bit
crowded and everything feels it's, like,

391
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,734
trading off against each other.

392
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,736
Normally, when you do a redesign,
as a designer,

393
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,030
you test it out a lot,
give it to a lot of people.

394
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,873
Like, someone needs
to sit over your shoulder

395
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,029
and watch how you interact.

396
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,370
For the first research study,

397
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,956
we broke down the components of a profile

398
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,918
and we separated them,
to get a very in-depth understanding

399
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:57,422
of what those individual components
meant to the user.

400
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,050
It needs to be something
that gets embraced by the community.

401
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,213
When you put something out
in the world on Instagram,

402
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,054
people need to eventually like it.

403
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,848
It has to do something better
than what came before.

404
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,850
And so that's going to be challenging.

405
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,523
Whenever I think about
my journey to design,

406
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,735
I think it just comes much more
from a creative and inventive place.

407
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:24,449
Being interested in sci-fi, Star Wars,
and, more importantly,

408
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,077
how those films were made
and the creativity

409
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,414
that went into inventing something
that didn't exist before,

410
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,207
like what ILM was doing.

411
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,627
I have images in my head right now
of, like, the grainy footage

412
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,339
of scale models, and how they were
set up, and the explosions,

413
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,466
and how they moved the camera.

414
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,054
You're seeing, basically,
the magician's tricks.

415
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,931
You're seeing behind the curtain there.

416
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,475
- Everything's armed, ready to go.
- Okay.

417
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,355
I didn't want to just go out there
and make my own films

418
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,919
and tell my own stories, necessarily.

419
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:01,320
But there was something about
the mechanics of dreaming that stuff up

420
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,322
and creating this alternate reality.

421
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,407
It was just so captivating to me,

422
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,161
this idea of art and science coming
together to create something magical.

423
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,705
You know, that was true
with, like, ILM and Star Wars,

424
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,333
and I think it was also true
with, Apple.

425
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,084
Thank you for coming.

426
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,543
You're welcome!

427
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,921
We're gonna make
some history together today.

428
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,384
When the iPhone came out,
I think the first notable thing was

429
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,219
the way it had to be described.

430
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,806
- I believe he described it as an iPod...
- an iPod...

431
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,683
- a phone...
- a phone...

432
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,853
and an Internet communications device.

433
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,272
This is one device.

434
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,069
Smartphones up until then,
the face of them had a screen up top,

435
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,989
and the bottom two-thirds were dominated
by this physical QWERTY keyboard.

436
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,659
The iPhone turned the entire front
of the phone into one big screen.

437
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,743
If the entire front of the phone
is one big screen,

438
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,907
how do you interact with it?

439
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,331
You have to touch the screen.

440
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,167
So, you've got highly visual,
highly tactile,

441
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,505
and the combination of those two things
mean that it's also highly adaptable.

442
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:05,634
It gave third-party developers the chance
to create applications for the phone

443
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,388
that Apple never would have had the time
or the money to come up with on their own.

444
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,265
On the back, the biggest
thing of note is a two-megapixel camera

445
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,183
built right in.

446
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,769
They networked a camera.

447
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:19,856
That's the fundamental transition
that happened to allow Instagram to exist.

448
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,984
Eventually, they put a GPS chip
in it as well,

449
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,071
and that also unlocked new capabilities.

450
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:30,283
Actually, a proto version of Instagram
was something called Burbn.

451
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,038
I went around
to venture capitalists and said,

452
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,442
"Hey, I want to build something."

453
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,250
They were like,
"What do you want to build?"

454
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,669
And I said, "Well, get this.
It's a check-in app."

455
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,422
And at the time, everyone
was building check-in apps,

456
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:47,801
and I was going to build,
like, the 19th version of a check-in app.

457
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:51,012
Burbn was actually particularly good
at allowing photo uploads,

458
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,266
and that was the thing that actually
people found most interesting.

459
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,893
And before you knew it, Burbn

460
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:01,523
slowly transformed into what would become
the beginning of Instagram.

461
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,234
They didn't try to do too much.

462
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,863
They picked one thing
and they did it insanely well.

463
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,991
Camera phone photos
were not of great quality at that point.

464
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:15,787
But by helping people
make small creative decisions,

465
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,974
they were able to create something
that they felt like

466
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,833
was worth putting out into the world.

467
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,587
They added these filters. That
meant they'd wanna share their photos,

468
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,423
because they looked better
and they felt almost like a postcard.

469
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,759
I think we had 25,000 people
sign up on the first day,

470
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,179
and that was more users than I had seen

471
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,097
on any service
that I worked on to that point.

472
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:39,978
That idea of creativity being born
through constraints is a powerful one,

473
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,981
and it's one that I think Instagram
brought to millions,

474
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,775
then tens of millions,
then hundreds of millions of people.

475
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:49,946
Facebook snapped up a tiny little company
called Instagram for one billion dollars.

476
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,199
It has just 13 employees.

477
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:56,161
Tonight, Instagram is worth
12 times more than Kodak.

478
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,372
So, tell me about
this thing called Instagram.

479
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:05,837
Yeah. Well, I... I knew about Instagram
only as a photo site.

480
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,799
At that time, it was... people were
sharing photos. That's all I knew about it

481
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,885
when Ian moved to Instagram.

482
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,888
And I didn't get the concept.
I don't... I mean, I really didn't.

483
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,265
I really... So, photos? Okay.

484
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,434
You know, I really didn't understand...

485
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,481
how popular it had... it is,
and how popular it has become.

486
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,692
I would say, "I just don't understand
why you would just look at photos

487
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,902
and be, like, ""

488
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,780
- Gets a little... boring after a while.
- And we're old.

489
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,282
And even though I say
I don't look at it that often,

490
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,785
I think I must look at it
about an hour or two a day.

491
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,079
- That's too much!
- Even though I say I don't,

492
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,372
and we say we don't...

493
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:44,042
we're still on it for, you know,
probably more than we should be.

494
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,014
I didn't travel much as a kid.

495
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,435
And it wasn't until I started working
more professionally,

496
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,105
gettin' thrown out
into these different parts of the world,

497
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,900
that I started to get windows
into these other perspectives.

498
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:12,153
Like... like, what normal is
in another place.

499
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:16,366
Maybe it's the flavor of potato chips

500
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,450
in London, right?

501
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,412
Or what a manhole cover
looks like in Japan.

502
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,085
As a designer, you're already tuned
to look at those details.

503
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,380
But then to see how other people
have dealt with that solution

504
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,465
is tremendously inspirational.

505
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,177
It feels like it hacked my brain a bit

506
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,763
to just see reality
from another angle, in a way.

507
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,266
Hai.

508
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,272
I actually went to Japan the first
time with a research trip and I was like,

509
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,773
"What is this?"

510
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,029
When you think about the things we value,

511
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,656
the Instagram design team,
and things I value personally...

512
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,618
around attention to detail and craft,

513
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:04,289
there's probably very few cultures that
hold that up as high as Japanese culture.

514
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,543
It's a place where all the details
kind of just tickle you.

515
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,296
Everything feels pretty considered.

516
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,759
And you're just soaking all that in.
So, it's stimulating in a different way.

517
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,055
I try to get to the point
where you're just there

518
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,599
and you're actually
just letting it flow through you,

519
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:26,227
like, what your eyes and ears...
and what you're smelling,

520
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,711
you're able to let that go through you,
that's what you want.

521
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:35,654
It's less about, "Eureka. I have
this amazing idea about this next thing."

522
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,377
It's, like, no, that's not what you want.

523
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,115
You want it to be able
to flow through you,

524
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,951
and that will create
the space in your mind,

525
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,912
so that when you come back
to those things,

526
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,122
there's more room to breathe and to see

527
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,583
different connections than you saw before.

528
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,347
What are we looking at today?

529
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,392
Profile redesign stuff,
Project Neue again.

530
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,935
Um...

531
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,188
Yeah, so we've been spending time
exploring different directions

532
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,191
and wanted to show you
the breadth of what we've done so far.

533
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,818
- Great, let's do it.
- Cool.

534
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:18,321
Bar Tab is kind of closer
to what we have today.

535
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,991
So, this is just kind of taking what
we have, this, like, familiar lock-up

536
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:26,413
and seeing what we can do to kind of make
some of these abilities a little better.

537
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,332
So, Sheety Bio. So, this one is...

538
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,960
what if you literally put content first?

539
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:36,172
So, this is showing, like,
it actually starts more like a gallery.

540
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,092
Do you guys have anything on device
that we could play with?

541
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,093
Yeah.

542
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,512
- Can I try one of those Sheety ones?
- Yeah.

543
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,848
Making large changes
to a big platform

544
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,641
is always going to be uncomfortable.

545
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,893
And so you have
o just make sure that you are

546
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,479
not making completely emotional decisions.

547
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,563
Yeah.

548
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,151
It's interesting to have
this layered feel to it.

549
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,154
- We also have this B-sides...
- Let's run through 'em.

550
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,115
I'm curious to see how crazy you guys...

551
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,616
- Yeah.
- Go for it.

552
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,826
Um...

553
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,661
It was like... basically, like,

554
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,330
what if your profile was just more like
a story composer

555
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,350
- and you could put what you want anywhere?
- Okay.

556
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,209
- Toss a gif up there.
- Okay.

557
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,973
I don't think this one's
really gonna work,

558
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,763
but we thought it was interesting
to explore.

559
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,174
Yeah, I don't think
this one will work either, but...

560
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,677
but it's important to...
find the edges, right?

561
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,805
You gotta fall off the edge
to know when you've gone too far.

562
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,474
So I'm glad you guys are pushing on it.

563
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,768
There's a bit of
defining the constraints,

564
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,687
understanding what people need.

565
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,647
Like, what are problems in the world

566
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,817
that we are in a position to solve,
that we have the permission to solve?

567
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,698
I didn't go outside a lot as a kid.

568
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:48,286
Maybe because I was shy or my mom didn't
want me playing with kids in the street,

569
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,579
or I don't know what.

570
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,998
But I was very attracted to computers

571
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,125
and kind of just gravitated to them, like,

572
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,836
if it was in a room,
I just kind of floated over to it.

573
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,589
The first computer that was mine

574
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,382
was a Commodore 64.

575
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,802
♪ Are you keeping up with the Commodore? ♪

576
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,137
♪ 'Cause the Commodore
is keeping up with you ♪

577
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,849
♪ In a world of fun and fantasy ♪

578
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,143
♪ And ever-changing views ♪

579
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:17,232
This was a birthday gift.
I think it was sixth grade,

580
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,317
and my dad got it for me.

581
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,862
I just remember the moment
of waking up...

582
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,365
and seeing it there, and just being

583
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,242
in awe of it.

584
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,577
I'll never forget that morning.

585
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,455
You had to basically type in
a special code

586
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,833
to load any software.

587
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,251
I still remember the line...

588
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,419
You had to type in "Load,

589
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,507
quote, star, quote,
comma, eight, comma, one."

590
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:46,511
That's how you... After you put
the floppy disk in!

591
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,930
That's what you had to do
to get anything to work.

592
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:52,642
And there was something about it
that felt so unique.

593
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,478
It's the possibilities,
you know, of creation

594
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,188
and just seeing that potential

595
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,649
that the thing on screen
could be controlled.

596
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,945
It's not just something being broadcast
to you, but you can actually change that.

597
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,627
Look.

598
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,798
- Man.
- Let me turn the light on.

599
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,302
64K memory.

600
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,348
What actually has mattered a lot
in my career

601
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,143
is not just talent or how hard I work
or anything like that.

602
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,520
It's also about the support

603
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,731
you have from people along your path.

604
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,025
It certainly starts from my parents,
right?

605
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:45,278
Giving me access to computing early on.

606
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,822
- You wanna try... plug it in?
- Let's see.

607
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:53,286
Ian gravitated
towards anything technological.

608
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,749
What... Whatever technical issues
anyone had in the building we lived in,

609
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,752
they would come to the door,
knock on the door, "Is Ian home?

610
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,962
We need Ian upstairs.
He's gotta hook up this,

611
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,797
- he's gotta hook up that."
- The cable.

612
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,007
Telephones.

613
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,886
Everybody's knocking on the door,
"Is Ian home? We need help."

614
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,432
I'm of mixed race, right?
So, my dad is white,

615
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,351
he's half-Jewish, half-Sicilian.

616
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,434
My mom's black.

617
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,313
And so I think that's impacted
just who I am as a person.

618
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,610
The fact that I have to think about
what my identity is

619
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,571
as a black person navigating this world.

620
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,034
In terms of the places
that I've chosen to work,

621
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,237
there are not a whole lot of people
that look like me.

622
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,416
When you're a black person
working in these environments,

623
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,836
there can be both a high bar
and a low bar for you.

624
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,423
You're in situations where
people don't expect a lot from you,

625
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:51,427
but, at the same time, the price
for failure seems very, very high.

626
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,515
Sometimes you can use that as motivation

627
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:59,018
to go above and beyond, you know,
just to kind of prove something.

628
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,188
Other times it can be kind of crushing,
doubt yourself.

629
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:07,318
I think that helps build my sense
of empathy for people,

630
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:11,572
and I think it helps my awareness
of the needs

631
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,367
of people outside of Silicon Valley.

632
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,998
When you're designing products,
you have to think about how people think,

633
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:24,460
how they approach each other,
how they approach abstract concepts,

634
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:25,962
like this...

635
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,839
touching on glass.

636
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,883
Seems to be a benefit that
the stories ring is always there.

637
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,176
- Yeah.
- So, you have

638
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,530
this co-mingling, even,
so you can kind of browse through,

639
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,888
you can jump into the story.

640
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,641
- That's kind of a new... dynamic.
- Totally. Totally.

641
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,769
A couple of years ago, I started
listening to Marc Maron's podcast.

642
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,815
And what I appreciated
about the podcast is it got into

643
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,443
different comedians' development processes

644
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,778
and how they put together an act.

645
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,197
Do you write in jokes?
Do you think in jokes?

646
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,950
Well, it's... it's not so much
the writing of the joke,

647
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,870
it's the listening to them bomb,
and then trying to rewrite them.

648
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,913
Listen to enough of these stories

649
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,750
and you hear about how iterative
the process is.

650
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,088
It helped me see points of connection

651
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,133
between what it is that me and my teams
do every day

652
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,843
and what comedians do every day.

653
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:18,056
Stand-up comedians
are in a position where

654
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,600
they have to come up with ways
to make people laugh.

655
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,353
They may work on the same bit
multiple times a night

656
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,231
in different clubs telling the same joke
a slightly different way,

657
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,568
taking that feedback,
adjusting it until it's tuned.

658
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,654
I don't want to tell you guys
how long she's been single.

659
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,948
But if you take the number of cats she has

660
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,202
and you divide it by the bottles of wine
she drinks a day,

661
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,536
it's 20 years.

662
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,413
She's been single for 20 years.

663
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,500
And so it's really interesting
to have a laugh be a data point,

664
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,126
because that's something emotional.

665
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,378
The laugh is a metric.

666
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:55,093
And when I bring it back to what we do,
there are plenty of areas in the product

667
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,804
where we try out things
to a limited audience,

668
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:01,724
and we get back data to understand how
that audience has used a certain feature.

669
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,519
And then we make changes
based off that feedback.

670
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,355
But we don't just look at the numbers.

671
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,649
It's really important
for us to keep our eyes open.

672
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:15,238
We also talk to people
and we travel all over the world

673
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,824
to understand
how people are using Instagram.

674
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,747
And so it's actually one of my favorite
parts about taking public transportation.

675
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,960
You can look over someone's shoulder
and you see what they're using.

676
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,130
We see unexpected things,
like patterns that they follow.

677
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:36,843
In the US, we see
a lot of selfies, a lot of text posts.

678
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,097
It's quite different
in a place like Japan.

679
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,975
There, we've seen
a completely different use case.

680
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:48,020
So, there are less selfies and people
are culturally different

681
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,522
in the way that they share.

682
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,941
It's a product
that people use all the time.

683
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,277
So, how does it fit in with the mix
of other applications

684
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,820
that they may have on their device?

685
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,780
Have they cracked their phone recently?

686
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:01,409
There's lots of different considerations,
given the scale of computing.

687
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,496
You know, the work he does affects
many, many people, and that's true.

688
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,790
But if I think about that, it scares me.

689
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,876
I wonder if Ian even thinks about it.

690
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,295
Does he... Does he think about it?
That's a lot.

691
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,754
That's a lot of people.

692
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,341
Interaction design, at its core,
is a psychological exercise.

693
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,837
If you've ever been scrolling through
your Twitter feed or your Instagram feed,

694
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,487
you've noticed you don't hit the bottom.

695
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,641
That's a relatively new feature,
called bottomless scroll.

696
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,686
And that was invented
by a designer named Aza Raskin.

697
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:32,106
Which I feel like
I have to forever atone for.

698
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,943
When I was thinking about infinite scroll,

699
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,820
like, the thought was...

700
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,656
I, as a designer, have failed

701
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,452
if I ask the user to make a choice
they don't care about.

702
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:49,707
So, scrolling already means "I haven't
seen what I want, show me more."

703
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,126
So, why bother having, like,
little buttons at the bottom

704
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,170
that you click to show... show more?

705
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:57,757
I as an individual designer
doing human-computer interaction,

706
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,134
like, will happily make
an infinite scroll.

707
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,345
But if I'm thinking at this higher level,

708
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:06,307
I would have known that
that would remove the stopping cues,

709
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,517
just like when I'm drinking
a glass of wine.

710
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:12,355
I stop drinking when I finish my glass,
and I think, "Do I want more?"

711
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,524
Here, we're not giving people
the stopping cue.

712
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:20,321
And so it's literally wasted
hundreds of millions of human hours.

713
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,573
It's no longer enough as a designer

714
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,701
to think about the constraints
of just one individual

715
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,161
using my product.

716
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,873
Instead, we have to think
the fractal version up

717
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,960
to technology-society interaction.

718
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,630
We haven't really fledged that out
as a field yet.

719
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:41,550
And now we're seeing that our technology
not only distracts us,

720
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,689
but if you think about what Facebook does,

721
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,847
they build a little simulator of you.

722
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,683
They build one of these little simulators

723
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,227
for one-fourth
of the human beings on Earth.

724
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,064
You are the product.
You don't get the service for free.

725
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,985
You are handing over your data.
You are being targeted.

726
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,488
This business model,
especially with Facebook, led to...

727
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,116
the proliferation of fake news.

728
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,827
It led to misinformation
being spread out there.

729
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,290
You know, there's a fine line
between micro-targeting, manipulation.

730
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,835
It's also allowing us to compare
our fake, fabulous lives

731
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,670
to other people's fake, fabulous lives.

732
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:21,382
I think that can be problematic
for a lot of us.

733
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,844
Because Facebook owns Instagram now,

734
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,388
there's been, I think,
more pressure on Instagram.

735
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,308
And especially now with the pressure
to make money,

736
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,352
especially with the pressure now
of Facebook not doing as well as it was,

737
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,938
and Instagram kind of being,
like, this golden child.

738
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,525
I think the challenge for Instagram

739
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,944
is going to be staying Instagram.

740
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,289
I think the focus on people
and human needs

741
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,000
has been something throughout my work.

742
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,563
Not just communicating a message,
but you're also trying to connect

743
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,340
with a human need or desire,
something core to you,

744
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,507
who they are as people.

745
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,384
All right, what's this one about?

746
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,219
So, this is a couple
of different things.

747
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,096
The first thing we wanted to dig into

748
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,391
is this problem that we heard a lot about,
vanity metrics.

749
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,810
When we talked to people
about their profile,

750
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,063
we got feedback
that they didn't necessarily like

751
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,106
the numbers at the top
of the profile that said

752
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,693
how many followers you have,
and how many people are you following,

753
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,613
because they felt
some sort of social pressure.

754
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,990
So right now, with the current design, um,

755
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,409
the metrics that we have,
the follower and following count,

756
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,952
is prominent, right up at the top.

757
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,913
- Yes.
- And that causes a lot of anxiety

758
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,539
in terms of popularity,

759
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,541
having a lot of friends
and their self-worth.

760
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,961
And so by placing the metrics
a little bit down below,

761
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,421
we're kind of humanizing it

762
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:46,717
and dulling down that anxious experience
of the ratios next to each other.

763
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:51,097
So, it would be a big step to,
like, downgrade overall followers.

764
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,933
Do you feel like that's...
That's a net good thing?

765
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,893
That's actually
our biggest concern

766
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,256
with the launch of the redesign.

767
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,271
This is probably the most sensitive thing.

768
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,274
That's like a drop-the-mic move, isn't it?

769
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,819
I interviewed one of the founders
of Twitter recently,

770
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,989
and his biggest regret, he said, was
putting your follower count on Twitter.

771
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,199
I was like, "Why?"

772
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,842
And he said, "It just put us down
a weird path. Like, incentive."

773
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,538
Like, you know, when it talks about
incentivizing people

774
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,790
to post for likes, or post for followers.

775
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,501
I mean, I think that tension
keeps me up at night, honestly.

776
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:24,296
The benefit that we have
is we can set those principles

777
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,215
and make them really clear to people.

778
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,302
The pace of change
in the past 20 years

779
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:34,098
has been pretty tremendous when it comes
to communication technologies.

780
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,392
But we also know it's just the beginning.

781
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,687
So, I think it's going to be important
to have a clear point of view

782
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,981
on where we want these tools to take us.

783
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,571
At the core, Instagram
is about visual communication.

784
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,533
So I feel like that's something
that there will always be space for,

785
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,119
that we're well-positioned
to continue to plan.

786
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,083
How close are we to be building out...

787
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,420
this version, or some version of this,
for any sort of first test?

788
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:08,215
Yeah, we're actually able
to phase these different tests out to see

789
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,342
how it affects the ecosystem soon.

790
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:16,640
So, we took out the Sheety Bio,
as well as the Card Shark and the Bar Tab.

791
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,310
And what we found was
that the Bar Tab was most favorable.

792
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,355
Only because it was not too different
from what they're normally used to seeing,

793
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,900
and it really helped them
better understand the profile

794
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,860
compared to their existing experience.

795
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,362
The design we ended up
moving forward with

796
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,406
and evolving from is called "Bar Tab."

797
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:36,285
We've moved the profile photo
and increased the size of it.

798
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,788
We've changed the prioritization
of the metrics

799
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:43,209
that currently exist in the profile
and made that a little bit less important.

800
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,921
We've made the descriptive copy
that people put in on their profile

801
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,172
more important.

802
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:53,010
And then we've also evolved
and created a new system for buttons.

803
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,805
A little more than a coat of paint,
you know, but not a full, like,

804
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,724
renovation down to the studs.

805
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,810
But, you know, design is never done.

806
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,313
It's something
that will continue to evolve.

807
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,941
The first launch
may be just the first step.

808
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,906
I've really benefited
from working in this space

809
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,492
and seeing these technologies evolve.

810
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,578
It's given me a tremendous perspective.

811
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:23,874
These tools are certainly transforming us,

812
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,293
and we don't yet know
where they're going to take us.

813
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,046
How many you going for?

814
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,132
- Five.
- Five? All right, we'll do five.

815
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,468
All right, ready?
Here you go. Ready? Give me one.

816
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,554
Good. Two.

817
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,139
For my kids,
I think the one thing that is certain

818
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,433
is that things will be uncertain.

819
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,937
I think that their ability to deal
with change will be pretty critical

820
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,481
to how they are able to survive as people.

821
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,193
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!

822
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,446
Right now, my kids don't have
phones still, even my 12-year-old,

823
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,824
and he actually has been explicit
about saying,

824
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,909
“I actually don't think I want one.”

825
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,581
Maybe this is a part of us working through

826
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,583
what it is to have these devices.

827
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,087
There's nothing that says
that we can't come up with

828
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,094
these new kind of expectations
and social standards.

829
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,602
We are inundated with so much information

830
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,646
that you need to give yourself the space

831
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,317
to experience the world
in an unmediated way.

832
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,783
To just be in a place

833
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,995
and use your natural given senses,
no tools.

834
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,668
It actually clears out a lot of the noise

835
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,589
and gives me the capacity
to either be creative

836
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:57,343
or be a better dad or a better husband
or a better boss.

837
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,139
The ability to zoom out for a minute

838
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,059
and get that clarity of perspective,

839
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,936
it's one of the best things
that we're able to do.
