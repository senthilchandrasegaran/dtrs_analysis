00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,598
[director] <i>Part of this is</i>
<i>I'm trying to figure out</i>

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,193
<i>some of the big picture things.</i>

3
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,358
<i>How aesthetically to tell your story.</i>

4
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:25,108
<i>And even before that,</i>
<i>kind of what your story is, you know?</i>

5
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,152
<i>Roll, camera.</i>

6
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,491
[Christoph] <i>I've been thinking about</i>

7
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,913
<i>how we would kind of</i>
<i>create the documentary.</i>

8
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:40,366
<i>And in my general state of anxiety</i>
<i>right now, I came to this question:</i>

9
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,247
<i>Is this about me, or is this by me?</i>

10
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,455
And you don't even see me drawing, right?

11
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,506
[director] We don't. We're just seeing
the top half of your head.

12
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,131
So you can act with your eyes.

13
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,851
[director laughs]

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,471
[Cristoph] <i>When I design</i>
<i>the experience for the viewer,</i>

15
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,978
<i>of course I want to come across</i>
<i>as good as I possibly can.</i>

16
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,111
<i>'Cause we're vain and we have to be.</i>

17
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,815
<i>And if it's about me,</i>

18
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:09,738
<i>it's a little bit, just tug of war</i>
<i>of how much do you make me reveal</i>

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,820
<i>and how much do I reveal</i>
<i>of stuff that I might not want to reveal.</i>

20
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,491
<i>But, ultimately, it's not about me.</i>

21
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,038
[director] Be an artist.

22
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,039
[Cristoph whispers] Be an artist.

23
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,706
[drumming]

24
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,689
[woman sings in German]

25
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,879
[clock ticks loudly]

26
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,802
[door opens and closes distantly]

27
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,972
[Christoph] <i>I would say everything</i>
<i>that happens between nine and six</i>

28
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,393
<i>is about work.</i>

29
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,850
<i>I work mostly by myself.</i>

30
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,688
<i>So I sit at my desk and I draw</i>
<i>and I design.</i>

31
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,896
<i>So I'm there,</i>

32
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,605
<i>and it's me and my art supplies</i>
<i>and my computer and my coffee maker,</i>

33
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,117
<i>so it's kind of me, me, me.</i>

34
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,961
<i>I'm such a control freak</i>
<i>that I would always love to sit down</i>

35
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,790
<i>and come up with the perfect formula</i>
<i>for creating art.</i>

36
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,421
<i>But it doesn't work that way.</i>

37
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,430
<i>It's a little bit</i>
<i>of a painful realization,</i>

38
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:41,679
<i>because, ultimately, it really is,</i>
<i>to a very large degree,</i>

39
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,973
<i>staring at paper.</i>

40
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:50,022
<i>And I have to trust</i>
<i>for kind of crazy moments to happen.</i>

41
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,244
[piano plays]

42
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:13,375
<i>I would say that abstraction probably is,</i>
<i>for me, the most important concept of art.</i>

43
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,586
<i>Where you say,</i>
<i>"Oh, I'm just drawing a simple box,</i>

44
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,434
<i>because I love things</i>
<i>that are not precious."</i>

45
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,556
<i>But it's the idea of, like, I start</i>
<i>with a thousand different thoughts</i>

46
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,179
<i>and then I, one by one,</i>
<i>throw them all out,</i>

47
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,347
<i>until, at the end,</i>
<i>I have the one or two or three</i>

48
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,517
<i>that are essential to the whole question.</i>

49
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,860
<i>But the abstraction, for me,</i>

50
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:42,413
<i>is this idea of getting rid of everything</i>
<i>that's not essential to making a point.</i>

51
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:05,256
This thing here, it's called
<i>The Good Shape </i>or <i>The Good Form</i>.

52
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:09,887
So I take this flatiron shape
and I start doing things out of it.

53
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,306
Men, women,

54
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,820
bathroom, strongman, nuclear power plant,

55
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,322
cowboys and Indians,

56
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,702
all sorts of sports.

57
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,582
[director] So what did your teachers
make of you?

58
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,460
<i>I had a very, very difficult teacher,</i>
<i>Heinz Edelmann,</i>

59
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,999
<i>who did </i>Yellow Submarine,
<i>The Beatles' movie,</i>

60
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,593
<i>and did amazing posters and book work.</i>

61
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:41,676
Fantastic designer, but let's say
he did not teach by encouragement.

62
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,638
The highest compliment that
you could hope for was,

63
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,641
"Oh, we don't really have
a problem with that."

64
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,182
That was like, "Yes!"

65
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,230
<i>When I grew up in South Western Germany,</i>
<i>I was always drawing.</i>

66
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,821
<i>It was all about getting action</i>
<i>and proportion right.</i>

67
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,608
<i>Drawing things very dynamic.</i>

68
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,164
<i>And that was the goal.</i>

69
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:10,661
<i>To kind of get there, to this, like,</i>
<i>hyperrealist, amazing painting.</i>

70
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,325
<i>And this is kind of the notion</i>
<i>that I went to art school with.</i>

71
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,625
<i>But the teacher I had at art school,</i>
<i>Mr. Edelmann,</i>

72
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,922
<i>he made it pretty clear that he really</i>
<i>disliked this stuff that I was doing.</i>

73
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:30,098
So I was drawing hundreds of sketches
on just letter-sized paper,

74
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,811
and each week, he would come in
and go through them

75
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,152
and basically say, "Nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope, nope."

76
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,523
"Oh, this one's okay!"

77
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,400
'Cause this is what we did in school.

78
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,903
Take a topic, like a red clown's nose,

79
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,606
and then just squeeze the hell out of it.

80
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,907
Just do every single variation.

81
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,946
[director laughs]

82
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:57,207
[Cristoph] <i>Eventually, I realized that</i>
<i>it's not about something super simple</i>

83
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,542
<i>like a black square or, like, one line.</i>

84
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,465
But each idea requires
a very specific amount of information.

85
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,638
Sometimes it's a lot: a lot of details,
a lot of realism.

86
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:10,138
Sometimes it's really just
this one line. The one pixel.

87
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:14,101
But each idea has one moment
on that scale.

88
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:18,444
<i>So, lets say you want to illustrate</i>
<i>the idea of a heart as a symbol for love.</i>

89
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:22,651
When you illustrate it,
as just, like, a red square,

90
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,534
which is the ultimate abstraction
of a heart,

91
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,742
nobody knows what you're talking about,
so it totally falls flat.

92
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,413
When you go all the way realistic

93
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:35,082
and draw an actual heart made out
of flesh and blood and pumping,

94
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,293
it's just so disgusting

95
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,253
that the last thing anybody
would ever think about is love.

96
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,804
And somewhere between
that abstract red square

97
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,128
and the real, kind of butchered heart,

98
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:48,394
is the graphic shape that kind of looks
like that, and kind of looks like that,

99
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,758
and it's just right to transport
this idea of a symbol for love.

100
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,400
<i>New Yorker</i> covers are the biggest deal
for an illustrator, I think.

101
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,494
Once you see <i>The New Yorker</i> cover once,

102
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,778
you see the history, you see the artist,

103
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,583
you see, most importantly, I guess,
the cultural impact.

104
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,004
This was my... This was the first one.

105
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,709
[director] What was the date?

106
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,749
July 9, 2001, the day I got married.

107
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,464
Which is especially fantastic.

108
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,262
<i>What I love is that this is</i>
<i>what they put on the magazine.</i>

109
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,510
<i>There's no headline.</i>

110
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,842
<i>There's not even a story.</i>

111
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:35,267
<i>This was July 4, 2001.</i>
<i>It was about the missile shield.</i>

112
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,558
<i>The Dr. Strangelovian generals</i>
<i>who start World War Three.</i>

113
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,152
There's no story about this idea
inside the magazine.

114
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,610
It's almost like the stage is pulled empty
and this is the image for one week.

115
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:52,866
The second cover
might actually have been... this one.

116
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:57,159
And, to a strange degree,
this might even be the most exciting one,

117
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,615
because the first cover of <i>The New Yorker</i>
is the Eustace Tilley,

118
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,167
<i>this New York dandy with a top hat.</i>

119
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,299
<i>And we said,</i>
<i>"Let's try to do an icon of an icon."</i>

120
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,296
<i>Making the butterfly just a blue square,</i>
<i>makes absolutely no sense</i>

121
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,216
<i>unless you know the original.</i>

122
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,277
<i>I've done 22, I think.</i>

123
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,195
<i>The thing is,</i>
<i>I never even thought about 22.</i>

124
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,577
<i>You think that</i>
<i>when you've done two or three,</i>

125
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,995
<i>all of a sudden it becomes, like,</i>
<i>"Oh, it's just another job."</i>

126
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:52,719
<i>It's not, because it's extremely exciting,</i>
<i>but it never becomes easy.</i>

127
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,604
[clock ticking]

128
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,679
[director] <i>So tell me about</i>
<i>this </i>New Yorker <i>cover you're working on.</i>

129
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,096
[Christoph]
<i>I'm doing this virtual reality cover,</i>

130
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,845
<i>which... It's more like augmented reality.</i>

131
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:11,989
So the idea is I have this magazine open,
on the front or on the back,

132
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,070
now I approach it
with my phone or with my tablet

133
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,116
and then this whole three-dimensional
animation comes out.

134
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,081
And you're just like, "No way!"

135
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:25,291
There's a lot of kind of levels
of metaphors and drawing to work.

136
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:29,045
And 3-D and 2-D and back and forth,
and it's kind of like physical and...

137
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,917
<i>And I also knew I couldn't plan.</i>

138
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,757
<i>I couldn't have one idea</i>
<i>that just solves the entire thing.</i>

139
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,814
<i>I had to start somewhere and then say,</i>
<i>"Okay, is this strong enough</i>

140
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,808
<i>or flexible enough</i>
<i>to just go to the next step?"</i>

141
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,601
[clock ticking]

142
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:47,305
So the magazine, in theory,
opened like that.

143
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,686
But I don't look at a magazine like that,

144
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,185
I think nobody ever looks
at a magazine like that.

145
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,318
So I thought, when I have a magazine,
I might look at it like that,

146
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,737
so, really seeing it
as the inside-outside world.

147
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,077
And I was thinking,

148
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,962
"What's... What's like a very
New York inside/outside scene?"

149
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,547
<i>I realized that a subway...</i>

150
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,183
<i>I have the windows,</i>
<i>I have people sitting in there</i>

151
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,299
<i>and then the whole subway can be...</i>

152
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,220
<i>Yeah, that's the idea of the magazine</i>

153
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,847
as the plane
that the person walks through.

154
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,515
You can see it from the inside
or from the outside.

155
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,867
It's a New York City cab, off-duty,

156
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,500
which you can see...

157
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,754
It's off-duty here.

158
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,917
This is... Let's make it busy.

159
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,665
This one's busy.

160
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:58,126
It looks better, though,

Why have you done so much New York work?

168
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,544
Well, it started with my connection.

169
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,791
It was the first city I went to
by myself...

170
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,714
and I think there's only one city
in your life that you go to by yourself...

171

Then you have a second child.

You think they're like the first one

280
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,405
because you're doing the same thing
you did with the first one,

281

turns out totally different.

There's too many lines in that side.

Just throw in something

And this is so wrong with that dry brush.

322
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,242
I wish I could rip out
the rest of the painting

323
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,445
and do more of that.

324
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,251
Obviously I'm playing around
for the camera now.

325
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:37,787
Dun, dun, dun...

326
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,712
Okay, next scene.

327
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,301
<i>I'm convinced</i>
<i>you always have to change direction</i>

328
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,595
<i>while things are good.</i>

329
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,849
<i>I was in my mid-30s, was extremely busy.</i>

330
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,346
<i>I felt fulfilled, but exhausted.</i>

331
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,651
<i>And I still think New York</i>
<i>is the best place to work,</i>

332
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,744
<i>but I feel like it's not a good place</i>
<i>to refill your kind of creative tank.</i>

333
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,155
<i>And I find it harder to reinvent.</i>

334
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,207
<i>I sensed that the only way to grow</i>
<i>required that I loosen up.</i>

335
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,677
<i>And it was in the mid-2000s,</i>

336
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:35,806
<i>my wife and I agreed that the only place</i>
<i>that we could imagine to move to</i>

337
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:36,931
<i>would be Berlin.</i>

338

00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,083
[Cristoph] <i>There's all these</i>
<i>kind of crazy galleries</i>

341
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,870
<i>that do stuff that makes absolutely</i>
<i>no sense whatsoever economically</i>

342
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,115
<i>and it's just totally a different mindset.</i>

343
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:48,627
<i>Berlin makes it easy not to worry so much</i>
<i>about the feasibility of an idea.</i>

344
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,973
<i>So my kind of, like, most intense phase,</i>
<i>in terms of my work,</i>

345
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,261
<i>actually happened when I moved to Berlin.</i>

[German song continues]

347
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,738
[director] <i>In a perfect world,</i>
<i>in this documentary,</i>

348
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,907
<i>and this will probably make you queasy,</i>

349
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:25,746
<i>there would be a moment where</i>
<i>there's a sense of unadulterated reality.</i>

350
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,044
<i>Just a glimpse.</i>

351
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,506
[Christoph] <i>I...</i>

352
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,798
<i>It would feel so completely out of place.</i>

353
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:38,965
<i>Like, it would be the farthest thing</i>
<i>from me ever showing anybody</i>

354
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,386
<i>how I brush my teeth.</i>

355
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,808
<i>When you show the real thing, you kill it.</i>

356
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,731
You make it impossible to then look
at these things in the abstract.

357
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:53,355
It's like in... I think in Charlie Brown,
you never see the grown-ups,

358
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,855
-you only hear these muffled voices,
-[muffled voice]

359
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,698
and that's perfect, that's amazing!

360
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,413
The one moment you zoom out
and show these grownups,

361
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:03,754
they could be designed perfectly,
they could be written perfectly,

362
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,871
but everything else
would be crashing down.

363
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,628
So, in a way, I feel like
we already zoomed out and showed,

364
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,631
even though I don't know
if I'm a grown-up,

365
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:15,013
but that's already far too big
of a zoom out.

366
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,432
And if you go even further there...

367
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:23,348
[director] So much of your daily routine
and life inspires your work.

368
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,103
It just seems
like we should be able to see it.

369
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,019
Well, yeah. I guess. Yeah.

<i>Okay, honestly nobody wants authenticity.</i>

372
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,030
Authenticity is like changing
your kid's diapers.

373
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:43,196
It's a cute idea in the abstract,
but the real deal is just...

374
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,713
<i>All I care about</i>
<i>is what's happening on the page,</i>

375
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,670
<i>because I want people</i>
<i>to really think about themselves.</i>

376
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,261
<i>What went into creating the art?</i>

377
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,550
[director] But people want to see you
in your real life.

378
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,675
We can't just film you
at your desk the whole documentary.

[Christoph] <i>Anything that's happening</i>

<i>But some stuff has to happen</i>
<i>outside the studio.</i>

383
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,164

[electronic music continues]

[Christoph]

<i>or even better, turned upside down,</i>

388
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:56,442
<i>just by looking at</i>
<i>a few strokes of oil paint on canvas.</i>

389
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,372
<i>That's the greatest thrill I know.</i>

390
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,043
<i>If experiencing art is so amazing,</i>

391
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,625
<i>how great must it be</i>
<i>to actually make this stuff?</i>

392
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,383
<i>And that's how they lure you</i>
<i>into art school.</i>

393
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,466
[electronic music continues]

394
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,815
[Christoph]<i> Everything I do</i>
<i>is kind of creating information,</i>

395
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:42,821
<i>creating usually images that do something</i>
<i>with what the viewer already knows.</i>

396
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:47,906
<i>Really the idea of, like, their experience</i>
<i>and my experience coming together</i>

397
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,245
<i>and the images are the trigger.</i>

398
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:59,174
<i>But the big, big problem with routine</i>
<i>is everything starts to look the same.</i>

399
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:04,965
<i>So I'm constantly trying to reinvent</i>
<i>how I approach image making,</i>

400
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,893
<i>how I approach storytelling,</i>

401
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,182
<i>because the audience changes all the time,</i>
<i>I change all the time.</i>

402

[chime music playing]

403
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,317
[Christoph]<i> When I was 12,</i>
<i>I taught myself to juggle.</i>

404
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,573
<i>At any given moment,</i>
<i>there's one ball in the air.</i>

405
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,286
<i>And this is something that I hate so much,</i>
<i>this idea of no control.</i>

406
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:33,706
<i>But this approach of not planning</i>
<i>opens a new door.</i>

407
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:41,881
<i>It's really, really hard,</i>
<i>but it just leads to these magic moments.</i>

408
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,454
<i>I started an Instagram project</i>
<i>called </i>Sunday Sketches.

409
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,408
<i>In terms of the response I've got,</i>

410
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:11,332
<i>they've been some of the better stuff</i>
<i>I've been doing,</i>

411
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,831
<i>but on the other hand, they're</i>
<i>the most useless things I've ever done.</i>

412
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,377
<i>There's almost zero control there.</i>

413
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,682
<i>For my professional work, I need control</i>

414
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,049
<i>because I need to be able to tweak,</i>
<i>to adjust, to plan.</i>

415
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,654
<i>But these </i>Sunday Sketches
<i>are un-plannable.</i>

416
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,400
<i>All the good ones just happen</i>
<i>by me just staring at something.</i>

417
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,405
<i>Like moving around the light,</i>
<i>and all of a sudden,</i>

418

<i>"Oh, now there's something happening."</i>

00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,195
<i>You can't sketch that.</i>

00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,670
<i>I never was a reader</i>

421
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,506
<i>because I never want</i>
<i>to escape from anything,</i>

422
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,841
<i>I want my real life to be interesting.</i>

423
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,805
<i>But then I read a book,</i>

424
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,978
The Invention of Slowness,
<i>I think is the title.</i>

425
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:21,823
<i>It's about a guy who is</i>
<i>so incredibly slow in his perception</i>

426

<i>that he can...</i>
<i>He actually sees shadows moving.</i>

<i>It's a good fiction book,</i>

<i>but the amazing thing</i>
<i>that I remember from reading that book</i>

429
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,294
<i>is, whenever I looked up from that book,</i>

430
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,750
<i>I felt I had this view from the book</i>
<i>in my real world.</i>

<i>This book made my life more interesting.</i>

433
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,395
<i>This is also in art,</i>

434
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,822
<i>something where you're not creating</i>
<i>an artificial world.</i>

435
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,120
<i>You're taking the things you know,</i>

436
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,791
<i>and then you break them down</i>
<i>into little elements.</i>

437
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,456
<i>And I rearrange them,</i>

438
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,590
<i>and all of a sudden make a statement.</i>

439
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,458
[calming music continues]

[Christoph]<i> Not with a monster</i>
<i>or a dragon,</i>

<i>but with a pencil.</i>

442
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,345
<i>I came from, you know, print media.</i>

443
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,568
<i>You just felt like it's always</i>
<i>going to be there,</i>

444
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,239
<i>people always need images</i>
<i>and they always need to be drawn,</i>

445
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,448
<i>and if you've figured it out, you're set.</i>

446
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,027
<i>And all of a sudden, it wasn't anymore.</i>

447
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:58,583
<i>It was about web long form pieces,</i>
<i>it was about animation.</i>

448
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,878
<i>Of course, it's our job to see</i>
<i>if there's some relevant way</i>

449
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,209
<i>that I can contribute to this new angle.</i>

450
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,466
So this is all of us, all the time.

451
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,138
So this is an app I did
over the last four years,

452
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,022
and I wanted
to do something interactive...

453
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:21,774
But the big question is

454
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:27,151
the moment I give too much decision-making
to the viewer over what can happen...

455
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,071
Often, the viewer
might have different ideas,

456
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,401
and you want to be surprised.

457
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,026
That's the whole point of books.

458
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:36,373
You want some surprise.
You want something unexpected to happen.

459
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:50,629
But here, in my literary section,
I have all these literature references,

460
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,974
like Don Quixote and Kafka,

461
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,505
Moby Dick,

462
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,966
a little Jane Austen,

463
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,271
and Homer,

464
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,478
and hopefully kids enjoy that scene
as much as grown-ups.

465
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:11,856
<i>Some people love it,</i>

466
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,026
and probably some people don't.

Some people love it,

468
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,874
some people don't.

469
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,042

474

[Christoph] <i>Yes!</i>

476

<i>these two personas separately.</i>

480
