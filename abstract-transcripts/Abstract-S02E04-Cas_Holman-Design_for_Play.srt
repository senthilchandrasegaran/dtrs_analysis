1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,054
When I design toys,
I want children to create

2
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,932
from their imaginations
rather than following instructions.

3
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,685
If I were to give kids a set of parts

4
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,770
and tell them to build a car...

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,856
there would be
a right and a wrong answer.

6
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:27,068
They already have an understanding
and archetype of what a car is.

7
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,695
It's a finished idea.

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,241
On the other hand, if I give them
the parts and pieces and say,

9
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,160
"Build a way to get to school,"

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,872
then there's room for many ideas.

11
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:42,751
And they could make a sidewalk,
or a rocket launcher,

12
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,544
or a bird saddle.

13
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,589
My work as a designer
is to give them these tools,

14
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:52,552
so that they are free to imagine,
explore ideas, and invent new things.

15
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,744
I wouldn't say
that I design toys per se.

16
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,333
There's a connotation with the word "toy,"
which is kind of frivolous.

17
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,670
And so I say that I design for play.

18
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,632
Which is kind of weird because it sounds
like I'm saying "designing foreplay."

19
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,009
So, it's not a perfect title...

20
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,179
but it's different
than designing play, right?

21
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,722
We don't design the play,

22
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,100
we design for the circumstances
of play to arise.

23
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,318
I have a hard time distinguishing
play from design.

24
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,113
In a way, a lot of what we do
in design is play.

25
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:38,199
Testing things out as ideas, as concepts,

26
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,536
but also as objects in space,
we’ll play with things.

27
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:47,125
I like to start
with kind of an experiential goal

28
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:52,630
and then design the object or the system
or the playground or whatever it is,

29
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,382
design that around it.

30
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,927
I've been working on something
called The Critter,

31
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,055
which is in the early phases.

32
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,475
I saw an old pommel horse

33
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,685
and they're so beautiful

34
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,147
and they're such an interesting
kind of abstraction of a horse.

35
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,066
And I remembered
that I loved playing on that.

36
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,903
And then I started looking
more at ride-on toys,

37
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,031
so some other old ones

38
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:22,952
that you might crank
to make it move forward.

39
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:27,040
And just kind of some simple versions.

40
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:34,047
The Critter has holes in it
and things plug in,

41
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,299
so if they want it to have wheels,
it can have wheels.

42
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,176
If they want it to have a rocker,

43
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,762
it can have rocking legs
that would plug in.

44
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:45,058
And then whatever
other kinds of, maybe, feet

45
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,810
or things that spin.

46
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,607
So, it can be a creature or a vehicle

47
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,652
or an invention of their own, hopefully.

48
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:02,033
All along the roofline in her studio
are sketch after sketch after sketch

49
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,244
that are stapled, taped, pinned.

50
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,329
Every time I go,
there's different sketches

51
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,332
and, you know, the next thing
she's thinking about.

52
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:15,213
I think of sketching
as an extension of my brain.

53
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,341
Like, I have an idea
and can't really figure it out

54
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,678
until my hand is helping.
So, sometimes I have an idea

55
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,932
of what it is in my head, but it's usually
not finished until I get it on paper.

56
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,478
I don't find words as useful as images.

57
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,731
So, in communicating it to other people,

58
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:38,778
I always manage to come at things
from a completely different direction.

59
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,324
So, when I worked
for a bigger design firm,

60
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,911
I would get called in to meetings
to be the wildcard.

61
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,539
Cas is a designer,

62
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,418
but she's, like, kind of
off the normal professional way.

63
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,753
She's like a kid

64
00:04:56,087 --> 00:05:00,258
and so happy and excited about stuff

65
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,677
that it makes everything
that she's doing fun.

66
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,596
When I was working
with Rockwell Group,

67
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,601
David Rockwell had started the momentum
of a kind of a pet project of his interest

68
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,186
of reinventing the playground.

69
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,731
I wound up on that project,
which was a dream.

70
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,525
When I was first put on that project,

71
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,278
I was just sketching
different forms of playground.

72
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,697
How can we make
a playground look different?

73
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:29,037
Beautiful sculptural things
and different ways of holding up a slide.

74
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,750
But I could tell it looked different,
but the play was the same.

75
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,171
So, I started doing this thing.
I would draw a child

76
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,381
in different positions

77
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,718
and then sketch a way to get them there.

78
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:48,973
So, the slide is adrenaline
and quick, uncontrolled movement.

79
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,726
How else can I facilitate that?

80
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,938
Ultimately, the design of the...

81
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,191
Now, they're kind of called
the Big Blue Blocks.

82
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,569
They're based on
the Caroline Pratt Unit Blocks,

83
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,531
the most basic modular building blocks.
They're just giant.

84
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,994
And we designed a way
for children to build and create

85
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,580
a playground that would change
and evolve throughout the day.

86
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,543
So, the Big Blue Blocks came out of

87
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,465
the idea of an ever-evolving playground
that's designed by children.

88
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,097
We tend to
downplay play, as if it's...

89
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:34,769
that frivolous, joyful thing that
children do, but it's really their world.

90
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,397
It's like the water that they swim in.

91
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,275
And so free play, where there's not
a right or wrong answer,

92
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:45,905
gives them this sense of
"I can do it, I can think for myself."

93
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,200
In psychology, we call it agency
or, you know, confidence.

94
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,661
But it's that idea
that the child really feels like,

95
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,914
"Hey, I had an idea, and I did it."

96
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,666
And that then spurs on learning.

97
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,295
I remember as a kid,

98
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,049
I began to learn
that our constructed environments

99
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:10,596
were places that enforced
certain hierarchies and power structures

100
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,850
that were not friendly to everybody,
particularly children.

101
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,686
And I have a few really specific memories

102
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,106
of being so mad about the height of sinks.

103
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,862
The height of sinks
I just thought made no sense.

104
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,823
I was aware
that they were not designed for me.

105
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,119
I just knew this is totally stupid
and adults are ridiculous

106
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,580
and these sinks are such a stupid height.

107
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,541
You know, 'cause I was like,
"An adult could use a low sink,

108
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,209
but children can't use a high sink.

109
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,254
Like, this isn't a hard problem to solve,
people. Come on, get with it."

110
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:53,306
I want my designs to speak to the weirdos.
Like, I don't know how else to say it.

111
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:59,437
But I want them to be tools
for children to feel understood.

112
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,317
My first product was called Geemo.

113
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,072
At the time, I was looking at a lot
of different patterns in nature,

114
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,909
and with Geemo, specifically bone marrow.

115
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,539
And so I was thinking about how one unit
can make an irregular pattern.

116
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,335
Geemo is on a three-pointed grid,
but the center is off.

117
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,378
Like, I scooted the center a little bit.

118
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,509
And so I made a whole series
of different parts and pieces with limbs,

119
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:34,472
figuring something out where it would join
and become all one piece.

120
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,642
And then the magnetic ends,

121
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,729
that was very specific
to it becoming a more open-ended toy

122
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,482
because I thought about
making them different colors,

123
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,025
that positive might be one color

124
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,027
and negative might be another,
so they match up.

125
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,405
But there's something,
I think, wonderful about

126
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,741
when the magnets don't meet.

127
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:58,454
And if it had the instructions
built into it through color coding,

128
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,500
you would figure that out and then never
do it wrong and never have that moment.

129
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,088
I worked with one company
that was gonna bring it into production

130
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,840
and kind of at the last minute, they said,

131
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,302
"Okay, so what are the characters?
What are the faces?"

132
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,305
And I was like,
"Wait, what? What do you mean?"

133
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,849
And they were like,
"Well, you know, obviously, the face."

134
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,561
And I just said, "Wait, what? How..."

135
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,855
Like, they had been making
an assumption about...

136
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,026
that this wasn't finished, that I was
going to put some kind of face on it.

137
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:32,738
And I was like, "Wait, no.
No, that's not that... What?"

138
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,034
I decided not to work
with them after that.

139
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,122
People say, "Well, does it...
But kids like colors!"

140
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,417
And I'm like,
"Kids are actually pretty sophisticated.

141
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,586
Like, they can play with a white toy

142
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:51,132
and appreciate that
the color isn't telling them what it is."

143
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,510
It won an award.

144
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:58,764
So, it launched in the New York
MoMA Design Store in 2006.

145
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,056
And...

146
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:05,146
I had a couple chances to license
the idea to another company,

147
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,523
but I was... young,

148
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,692
naive, and arrogant.

149
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,446
So, I said, "I'll just...
I want to do this myself."

150
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,408
Which, trial by fire.
I learned so much

151
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:21,037
and it took years and a lot of money.

152
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,791
And there were times that Geemo
had a studio and a place to live,

153
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,043
but I did not.

154
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,463
The running of that part of the business,

155
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,423
it was all I was doing.

156
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,425
And I realized that,

157
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,303
you know, what I wanted to be doing
was designing more toys.

158
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,891
My company is called Heroes Will Rise,

159
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,018
and I launched it in 2006.

160
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,979
Essentially, we tried to design it

161
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,148
such that there are...

162
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,692
In and of itself, it's modular
for the manufacturing.

163
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,987
So this is a scale model
just with foam core of this one.

164
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,198
- Three and a half?
- Three and a half.

165
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,494
I no longer have to live on couches,
which is nice.

166
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,329
I'm no longer doing it alone.

167
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,582
I have an incredible business manager
named Doug Johnson,

168
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,376
who was a game-changer.

169
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:14,965
The motto and kind of the driving force
is "easy is boring."

170
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,762
"Easy" meaning something
that doesn't engage your thinking.

171
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,099
There's an assumption
in the field of design

172
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,142
that easy is great, right?

173
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,687
"My God, I have to push three buttons,
that's a problem.

174
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,330
I should just have to push one button."

175
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,441
And I'm not quite sure
why that's a good thing.

176
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,487
When I was in Japan, I became familiar
with this partnership,

177
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,658
Arakawa, he was an architect,
and Madeline Gins, who was a poet.

178
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,787
And Arakawa and Gins
had a kind of a thinking group

179
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,164
that was called
Architecture Against Death.

180
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,584
And the core of their ideas was that

181
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,671
if life is predictable, you're a zombie.

182
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:58,467
So the Architecture Against Death
was about, "Why do floors need to be flat?

183
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,720
What if you had to pay attention
while you walk?"

184
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,764
You know, "Why do we have
rectilinear corners?"

185
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:08,352
So the idea is that you should be aware
and be paying attention,

186
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,730
and that's how you stay young
and continue thinking.

187
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,234
I kind of, like, was poking around
and realizing...

188
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,112
"Right, we kind of have, like...
Toys are kind of crap."

189
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,535
They're plastic. They're, like...
They're not... They're just...

190
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,330
They're... They're not something
kids are getting something out of.

191
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,497
Mama!

192
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,127
I started to feel like they were
designed to keep kids occupied...

193
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,296
or they were designed to sell.

194
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:40,634
But they weren't really designed
with children and play value in mind.

195
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,722
Lots of toys are very goal oriented.

196
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,766
They look like something,

197
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,642
there's one way to play with it.

198
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:52,772
So, you quickly figure out it can go
this way or that way and then you're done.

199
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,066
So it sort of shuts down
that building on their own

200
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,778
pleasure and engagement and enjoyment.

201
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,866
You see Rigamajig being used
by a group of kids

202
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,659
and you get it.

203
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,621
You have an emotional understanding of it.

204
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:13,000
Rigamajig is a kit of parts

205
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,170
that could be seen as a learning material.

206
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,381
It could be seen as a toy or a playground.

207
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:24,220
I think of it as a glorified pile
of construction debris.

208
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,181
There are so many parts and pieces to it.

209
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,517
It has planks, nuts and bolts,

210
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,062
some corner brackets,
hooks, and there's a pulley.

211
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,690
What I did in designing it,
I wanted children to be able

212
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,194
to build without mastering a tool.

213
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,363
So, I wanted it to be

214
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,575
intuitive and usable for small hands.

215
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,370
I took the... kind of a wingnut,

216
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,414
and I took the wings off of the nut
and put it on the bolt,

217
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,334
so the bolt and the nut
can easily be screwed in

218
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,420
and actually get pretty tight
without using any kind of tool.

219
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,090
And those are intentionally black.

220
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,634
They are meant to look like real hardware.

221
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,512
The boards are three-quarter-inch plywood.

222
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,723
They're heavy planks. You know,
it's a very large, heavy piece of wood.

223
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,978
Children really often when they first
encounter Rigamajig say, "This is real."

224
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,568
You can see them kind of like,
"Okay," you know.

225
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:24,864
And they play with it differently,
and they know that they can impact space

226
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,658
and that they can make something
larger than themselves,

227
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,785
and being entrusted
with real materials

228
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,620
is also hugely empowering for them.

229
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,584
Originally, Rigamajig was part
of a commission

230
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,420
by the Friends of The High Line
in New York City.

231
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,298
It was
the High Line Children's Workyard Kit.

232
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,552
And was just so successful,

233
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:50,055
and I got such great feedback,
specifically from teachers,

234
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,601
saying, "This is wonderful.
I want to use this in the classroom."

235
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,856
I tried to sell it
to some other companies.

236
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,191
They were like, "This is too weird."

237
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,987
I started to bring it to the market
on my own.

238
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,032
The first time I showed it,
I was pretty discouraged.

239
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,784
The feedback was like,
"Where does it even fit in?"

240
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,455
You know, it's really hard
trying to put it into one of the boxes

241
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,791
in the industry, 'cause there's really
nothing else out there like it.

242
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,503
I'd like to see a lot more of it,
personally,

243
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,090
'cause things do seem
too repetitive and prescribed.

244
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,469
And I think kids
want the more open-ended,

245
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,471
and I think they need more open-ended.

246
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,848
You know, they get taught
enough instructions.

247
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,310
If we manufactured
our children in a child factory,

248
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,355
they'd all be alike.
Then we could teach them very easily.

249
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,984
I've always been interested in,
"How can school be different?

250
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,668
Why does school have to look like that?"

251
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,113
Elementary schoolroom USA.

252
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,200
It's a wonderful part
of the American scene.

253
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,702
It's commonplace, but important.

254
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,413
And it's quite the same
whether it's in a big city,

255
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,666
average town, or country hamlet.

256
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,338
The rows of desks,
there's an expert at the front.

257
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,508
The assumption that,
like, we're just an empty sponge

258
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,344
and the teacher
is the vessel of knowledge.

259
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,054
"I'm gonna tell you a bunch of stuff,

260
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,890
and now it's in your brain
and now you know it."

261
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,478
We're still using a model that was
developed around industrialization.

262
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,147
It was developed
to make factory workers.

263
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,402
I figured this out pretty early on
that in school,

264
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,405
what I was being assessed on
was how good at school I was.

265
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,865
And then we reinforce this with SATs
and things like this.

266
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,995
But this is not a gauge of intelligence.
It's a gauge of how well you take tests.

267
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,081
School was hard.

268
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:44,086
Like, when I saw my peers doing well,
I just was like,

269
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,338
"All right, I guess
they're just smarter than me."

270
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,300
And I think the things that I'm good at
weren't celebrated

271
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,845
and they weren't seen
as something that was smart.

272
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,472
And it just didn't make sense to me

273
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:59,101
that we were spending
our childhood indoors.

274
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,063
Classroom should be about
the world that's outside,

275
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,900
not its own weird tomb
of archaic knowledge.

276
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:14,783
Working with design students and designing
for children or early education,

277
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,870
it all starts to feel
like it's all the same thing,

278
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,749
and I think that my teaching
with undergraduate art students

279
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,126
is more influenced by

280
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:29,006
what I know and have understood about
early education than vice versa.

281
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,468
Let's start over here.

282
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,012
We're not critiquing a final piece.

283
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,724
We're testing, so I think
it's up to the artist what...

284
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:42,770
Think about what you want to learn, right?
Or what you're curious about.

285
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,940
Be strategic about what you tell us.
Right?

286
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,527
In the classroom,
we play constantly.

287
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,073
So, the longest part
is the cylinder that goes up,

288
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,077
and then this is the most confusing shape,
'cause I don't know the name for it.

289
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,954
It's like a cylinder
has been carved into it.

290
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,414
- Is this your object?
- Hey!

291
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,292
This is the object.

292
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,300
My first year of teaching, I had
the Introduction to Design students.

293
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,760
I had so much fun

294
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,098
designing these exercises
and these assignments for them.

295
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,891
We were calling it Name By Function.

296
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,814
So instead of saying,
"Let's all design a mug,"

297
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,770
it's like, “Design a way
to transport water.”

298
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,817
So, you know, they'll have them sketch
ten ways to transport water

299
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,653
not found in the kitchen.
Okay, so there's a hose...

300
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,281
The really great thinkers will say, "Okay,
you know, my hands cupped together

301
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,868
is a way of transporting water."
"My mouth." "A sponge."

302
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,329
And then I'll say,
"Okay, now sketch ten more."

303
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,499
It's a fun exercise to do
with beginning design students

304
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:49,044
who thought that they were going to come
to school and design shoes and cars.

305
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,423
And I'm like, "No! Let's have
an existential crisis instead."

306
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,351
Growing up, we lived in the woods
in Grass Valley, California,

307
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,602
near the Yuba River.

308
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,775
It's all just gorgeous, hot rocks.

309
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,529
I was almost always outside.

310
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,867
And so,

311
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,537
I think I understand,
through my own experience,

312
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,250
the value and the joy
and the importance of play.

313
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,798
And particularly of free play.

314
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,136
I was raised by a single parent.

315
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,138
My mom worked a lot.

316
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,851
So, I mostly played alone. I was what
would be considered a latchkey kid,

317
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,477
but the house didn't have keys,

318
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,104
so that never fit.

319
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,625
People would say, "You're a latchkey kid."
I was like, "No, I don't have a key."

320
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,649
Real literal about it.

321
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,944
And it's hard

322
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,923
when I think about her when somebody says,
you know, "What did you do?

323
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,616
What was your play?" And I'm like, "..."

324
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,702
That's... It was play, so it was noth...
Like, I don't...

325
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,371
I don't know, I was outside doing, like...

326
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,541
Poking a dead thing with a stick.

327
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,425
Like... It's this... Climbing a tree.
I don't know what I did up there,

328
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,302
but I was doing it for three hours.
Like, that's also the point of play

329
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:20,594
is that there's not an outcome
other than that it's intuitive.

330
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,474
I made a mark here
about where ten was.

331
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,808
Ten yards.

332
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,619
So are you going to shoot after I shoot?

333
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,730
- Yeah.
- Good.

334
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,615
- It's such a satisfying sound.
- Okay. It is, isn't it?

335
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,369
I always wanted my kids
to take their curiosity

336
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,912
just as far as it would go.

337
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,331
You know? So, I always encouraged that.

338
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,414
Wow.

339
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,043
I think I almost held the thing still
at that point.

340
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,753
- Good.
- No finger...

341
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:55,921
When she was young,

342
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,590
our property had been cleared
of a lot of manzanita,

343
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,801
but they'd never been really dug up,

344
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,887
so there's all these
little manzanita stumps all over the yard.

345
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,307
And she would go out there barefoot,
and she would always be hurting herself

346
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,768
and stubbing her toes.
And so she told me

347
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,312
that I needed to go out there
and clear the yard.

348
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,233
And I said, "Well, why don't you put on
some shoes when you go out there?"

349
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,611
"I can't be bothered with shoes.
I'm too busy playing."

350
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,114
So, that was her attitude.

351
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,992
Here's attitude right here.

352
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,577
I didn't worry too much.

353
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,123
You know, we always made sure that when...
before they jumped off a rock,

354
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,417
they knew they needed to check
the depth of the water

355
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,419
and what they were jumping into
type thing.

356
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:39,298
But as far as what their actual choices
to do in that space,

357
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,466
I... I didn't really worry too much.

358
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,638
This would be the mom section.

359
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,724
And this is the Cas section.

360
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:54,187
I think that all humans play
because we have to.

361
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,191
Increasingly,
we're starting to understand

362
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,444
how much animals play, not just to learn.

363
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,740
We know that children and animals
will play as a way of learning.

364
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,241
Bears play fight,

365
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,827
and that's kinda how they're learning
to actually fight.

366
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,620
But they also play for enjoyment.

367
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:15,375
This is the beauty of YouTube.
We can now watch videos of crows

368
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:20,464
using a yogurt lid to slide down a roof
that has snow on it

369
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:24,634
and then climb back up and slide down
again for no purpose other than play

370
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,595
and the enjoyment of the act.

371
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,767
Play is as essential as food, air, sleep,

372
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,894
whatever else we have to do to stay alive.

373
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,272
Play is therapy. It engages our brain,

374
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,151
it gets our body and our mind
back in tune with each other.

375
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,946
As kids, we lose some of the inhibition
that happens on a playground,

376
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,200
but it translates into different places
in our lives, I think.

377
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,871
Moving our bodies around, whether
it's in some kind of sport or exercise

378
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,166
or, for me,
dance has more of a flow to it.

379
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:01,338
Dancing is more than
part of my inspiration process.

380
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:06,259
I think dancing is part of
my "being a sane human" process.

381
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:11,431
I enjoy dancing quite a bit,
and I'm a very good breakdancer.

382
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,394
I came up with this persona
when I was living in San Francisco,

383
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,146
a fellow named Electro,
the Pop and Lock King.

384
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,316
And I was doing drag
at a club called Tranny Shack.

385
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,446
And really amazing, active, creative
performance art, drag scene.

386
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,739
In the meantime,

387
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,951
I was trying to pretend to be
a person who could work in an office.

388
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:35,372
At the time, The Maury Povich Show
was doing these pageants.

389
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,250
"Is it a man or a woman?"
While the audience shouted,

390
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,709
"It's a man! It's a woman!"

391
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,211
She's a man, baby! Yeah!

392
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,422
Which is so beyond messy now,
and I kind...

393
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,174
I knew that at the time also,
but I'd never been to New York.

394
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,594
And I said, "So...

395
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,640
is it okay if I take this day off
to fly to New York

396
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,809
to be on The Maury Povich Show?"

397
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,728
Flip to two months later
when the show aired,

398
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,981
they shut down the entire office,

399
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,984
and we all piled into the conference room
to watch it on TV.

400
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,735
So, Electro, come on out!

401
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,449
Which was...
Well, it was mortifying.

402
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,789
But it was also amazing, because here
were these people being super supportive

403
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,125
and embracing that side of me,
which I thought

404
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,043
had previously been kind of secret.

405
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,006
Moments like that where I'd realize

406
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,842
I didn't have to separate my selves.

407
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,220
I think half of the reason
that I liked performing

408
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,140
was making all of the costumes
and the sets.

409
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:40,145
And I started doing more, like,
"Why don't I do, like, Pegasus drag?

410
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,191
Or hot dog drag?" So, my costumes
were getting more elaborate.

411
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,235
That a little bit
fulfilled the creativity,

412
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,904
but I always had some version

413
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,531
of a studio where I was making
other things on the side.

414
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:56,369
I was making furniture and these kind of...

415
00:24:56,786 --> 00:25:00,749
elaborately fabricated
cast epoxy toilet seats.

416
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,667
But they sold in galleries.

417
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,462
They were 400-dollar toilet seats.

418
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,174
But it was really important to me
that people put them on their toilets.

419
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:13,970
That was the first thing that I considered
putting into mass production.

420
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,849
And then I realized
that epoxy goes nowhere.

421
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:22,395
It'll be here for so many thousands
of years after I am dead.

422
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:28,068
We're burning through
non-sustainable objects faster and faster.

423
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,072
So, I'm very careful
about what I put into the world.

424
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,375
So, with Critter,
the stage we are at now is

425
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,961
I'm starting to develop it
and thinking about materials,

426
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,964
and have talked to
a couple of different companies

427
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,551
about how they might
want to develop and market it.

428
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,388
I imagine it'll be a combination
of different materials:

429
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,432
wood and some kind of
soft plush sorts of things,

430
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,352
as well as some probably rigid components.

431
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:06,064
And then for the plug-ins, or the doodads,
as I've been calling them,

432
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,691
these are more of a sketch model.

433
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,777
They're just, like, whatever cardboard
I had laying around,

434
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,114
um, hot glue and tape
to hold things together.

435
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:18,034
So, really quick ways to figure out
how they'll work.

436
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:22,998
Like, this can be both a robot claw
and a foot and maybe a moon.

437
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:28,003
Any toy could be
turned into a non-open-ended toy.

438
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:35,218
The way I see it working against the child
is that it says to them,

439
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,596
"Either you do it right
or you do it wrong."

440
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,682
If you feel like you're not good
at something, you just retreat.

441
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,977
Children are curious.
They want to engage with the world,

442
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,439
and you give them open-ended toys,
they're much happier.

443
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,610
- This is one-third scale model.
- Right.

444
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,653
And this is a three-year-old.

445
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,531
I'll take the prototype

446
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,409
and give it to kids,

447
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,662
teachers, parents,
whoever would have some expertise,

448
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,665
and, of course,
they always have really helpful input.

449
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,585
From a three-year-old's
point of view...

450
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,920
- I hadn't thought about that.
- Well, you can peek in.

451
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:14,466
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And children like to see or peek.

452
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,177
You know, "Are my things in there?"
Plus, I can open it and peek.

453
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,681
I didn't think about that, which
could be really fun with color, right?

454
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,808
- If the things inside of it...
- Are colored.

455
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,768
Like, somehow...

456
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,770
- Or if even the insides of the...
- Even if...

457
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:30,607
That's what I was thinking.
Or even if the inside of this has color.

458
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,858
- Yeah.
- So they can...

459
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,276
Like, if this were...

460
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,986
Right. We could kind of color

461
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,529
- the insides of the...
- Yeah.

462
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,784
When I saw it, I thought,
"Mailbox or birdhouse?"

463
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,704
But the more we talked about it,
the more I could see,

464
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,207
“There's so many possibilities
with it."

465
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:51,544
It's that it says a child could take this
and do whatever they want with it.

466
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:55,548
Says to the child,
"Your ideas are really important." Right?

467
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,425
'Cause if you've created something

468
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,054
and it was your ideas and now
you carried them out, then it's yours.

469
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,140
Here's a child activist mobile.

470
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,018
It's a megaphone.

471
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:11,439
Design is kind of my tool
for activism, in a way.

472
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,776
I find myself in big box stores.

473
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:18,279
There's, like, the pink aisle
and the blue aisle. It's infuriating.

474
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,656
It makes no sense.

475
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,784
There are children who like pink
and children who like blue.

476
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,037
Why we've assigned that
to boys and girls is absurd.

477
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:30,875
It's just not how children... are,
or it is how they wind up being,

478
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,079
because that's what...
the options that they're given.

479
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,089
Introducing the new
GI Joe Adventure Team.

480
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,341
Five rugged men with lifelike hair.

481
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:42,011
She changed it ten times,
and she wants it curly again.

482
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,514
Better fix Ken a sandwich.

483
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,893
It's important to me
to have some positive impact,

484
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:53,022
in particular, when I see things
that I struggled with in childhood

485
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,899
that I don't think were necessary.

486
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,613
I probably started having
an awareness of gender,

487
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,323
it was maybe around third grade.

488
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,702
I knew that, you know, there were
boys and girls and I was a girl.

489
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,747
But there was a point
at which I was meant to stop...

490
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,292
To start... Well, stop being a tomboy.

491
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,589
Simultaneously,
my dad was not happy with me

492
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,591
not growing out of a tomboy.

493
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,677
And he was in charge of a lot of
the back-to-school shopping.

494
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,930
He caught me sneaking over
into the boys' section to get the clothes

495
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,184
to bring them into the girls' section.
I thought he wouldn't figure that out.

496
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,394
And then he just was
not going to buy me clothes.

497
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,396
I needed to get over it.
I needed to grow up.

498
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,442
And so that was the first time that
I realized it was going to be an issue.

499
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,197
Then I started, I think,
noticing in other places

500
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,908
where men and women
were treated differently

501
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,328
and that the expectations were starting
to get really inconvenient.

502
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,208
It felt like there was
a set of rules that

503
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,462
if the other girls didn't follow,
those wouldn't be expected of me.

504
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,756
So, I was, like, a little bit mad
and disappointed

505
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,592
at them for following the rules
of wearing dresses

506
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,385
and screaming
when you see a worm.

507
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,933
But I think it's always been
a huge presence.

508
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,271
It's a lens through which I have no choice
but to see the world.

509
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,236
And did your dad,
like... What happened there?

510
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,613
No, he never came around. He's still mad.

511
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:30,078
No. It's, um... I mean,
if only that were our only issue.

512
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,500
I think...

513
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:40,630
the fact that I'm a feminist
and my gender is a bigger issue for him

514
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,382
than the fact that I'm queer.

515
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,593
I...

516
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,763
don't need to psychoanalyze him,
but we don't talk.

517
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,474
We haven't... We periodically would go

518
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,352
a year, a couple years without speaking...

519
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,773
Um, but I was recently
officially disowned.

520
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,903
At this point,
we're, like, going on 25 years of therapy.

521
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:08,908
So, I can live without a relationship
that just makes me feel crappy.

522
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,546
I didn't know that Alesdair was...

523
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:25,842
something that I could have,
let alone even want to have.

524
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,720
I understood vaguely
when people talked about

525
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,016
their primary person and love
and true love and whatnot.

526
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,269
And, of course, I've had many versions
of lots and lots of love.

527
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,856
Um... but this one's
pretty stinking good.

528
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,024
Yeah.

529
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,920
She invited me to this party
after a month had gone by,

530
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,696
and I thought, "What do I have to lose?"

531
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,283
And I immediately came in
and she took a blowtorch,

532
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,497
- and was like...
- I was trying to impress him.

533
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,372
"Let me show you the bubbles in the pond."

534
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,708
And so she comes out with the blowtorch

535
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:04,213
and just starts blowtorching the frozen...
brook, being like, "Isn't this cool?"

536
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,966
- And, to be fair, it was pretty cool.
- It was cool.

537
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,060
After I came out to you...

538
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:22,106
the initial conversation was...
was hard and didn't go well and...

539
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,483
You know...

540
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,110
It probably felt for a while
that it was gonna be something

541
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,779
that was not gonna be forever.

542
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,449
I'm like, "Really?"
You didn't think I was gonna stick?

543
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,826
So specifically this one didn't...

544
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,871
That I was going to grow out of it,
and, like, how could you...

545
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,374
Really, Mom? At some point,
you called me up out of the blue

546
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,211
and you said, "I was just watching
the news and in Sacramento..."

547
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:47,423
And I remember you saying
it was a gay protest, and I was like,

548
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,509
"We call those Gay Pride parades."

549
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,552
And you said, "But there was a woman

550
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,888
carrying a sign that said,
‘I love and support...’"

551
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,727
It said, "I love and support
my lesbian daughter."

552
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,730
And you said, "And I realized that,

553
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:07,318
of course, I love, but I haven't really
supported you as a lesbian daughter."

554
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,363
I remember this conversation.

555
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,199
And you apologized, and, um...

556
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,161
I was... That was...
It felt like a big moment.

557
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,245
Yeah.

558
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,124
And it made my life much easier,
in fact.

559
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,380
As I've been able to...

560
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:34,262
have more control over being in places
and being surrounded by people

561
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,764
that are supportive of who I am

562
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,684
and who I can contribute
to a community of people

563
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,103
who support and love each other...

564
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,149
I have less and less tolerance
for places that aren't like that.

565
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,275
Come here.

566
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,069
In my mind, I want...

567
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,655
every... Like, I want language,

568
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,035
I want gender, I want all of those things
to work like a basic building block.

569
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,165
A basic building block, that can be

570
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,877
a car or a whale or a hat.

571
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,131
To have the malleability

572
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,426
that that has as kind of a placeholder

573
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,055
for our imagination to kind of build from.

574
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,849
So, who can tell me what, um...

575
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,894
what an inventor is? What's an inventor?

576
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,232
The reason that I design
for children is I'm designing for people.

577
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,860
These are the people that are gonna,

578
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,863
like, make the world suck
or not suck. Right?

579
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,532
Good toys make good people.

580
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,576
And I really believe in that.

581
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,579
Who's got a question...
Who's got a question for Cas?

582
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,249
What gave you the idea
of making Rigamajigs?

583
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,835
Well, I noticed

584
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:51,464
and I know that you all are capable

585
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,675
of building things
that are big and exciting,

586
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,261
and that you have ideas
of what you want to build

587
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,972
in such a way that you would get to choose
what you were making

588
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,141
rather than me telling you what to make.

589
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,522
Rigamajig has been on the market now
for five years.

590
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,733
It translated more
to being in the classroom

591
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,027
to teach curricular needs.

592
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,613
But also collaboration.

593
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,908
There's a lot of collaborative
opportunities with materials that big.

594
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:22,078
It's designed in such a way
that children need each other.

595
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:26,958
You have to get somebody to hold this end
while you're screwing in

596
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,252
the bracket that's over there.

597
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,106
Well, they don't know
what's going to come out of it,

598
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,191
because hopefully, in its best case,
it's open-ended.

599
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,509
So, nobody knows
what the children are gonna build.

600
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:40,346
Nobody knows what kind of interpersonal
dynamics are gonna come out,

601
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,306
nobody knows where it might go.

602
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,852
Of course, the children, I don't think,
experience that as vulnerability.

603
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,646
I think, for the kids,
that's all just play, it's all unfolding.

604
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:55,444
My biggest challenges
are other people's perceived rules.

605
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,906
Our overarching perception of risk

606
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:02,493
and what is an acceptable level of risk
for children in play.

607
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,915
It's hard to remember
that those are not real.

608
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,921
Children can have a big heavy board
and not get hurt.

609
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,091
What do we say to Cas
for inventing Rigamajig?

610
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,926
Thank you!

611
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,597
Thank you for playing,
and thank you so much for sharing with us.

612
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,517
Prior to the Fast Company article,

613
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,811
I think Cas was a little-known secret.

614
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,608
Mostly through social media,
all of a sudden, she became known.

615
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,776
Rigamajig became known.

616
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,237
And so we had people contacting us

617
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,239
that we had never done outreach to.

618
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,748
A couple years ago,
someone contacted me and said...

619
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,042
"I've seen your stuff
in use in China.

620
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,502
It's a region of schools that I work with.

621
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:57,590
They have a couple of prototypes
of something similar to Rigamajig.

622
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:01,093
Basically, long story short,
you're being knocked off in China.

623
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,387
But not by us,
'cause we'd like to work with you."

624
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,099
And so, my...

625
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:12,021
my first instinct, hearing that Rigamajig
was being used in some schools there,

626
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,940
I thought, "That's much better than

627
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,901
whatever stereotype
of Chinese schools I had."

628
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,821
Then I also thought, “Well, let me see
what they've done with it,

629
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,242
because I'm sure they've changed it
slightly, and maybe they improved it.”

630
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:28,871
And she just started showing me
these images of what they call Anji Play.

631
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:36,337
Kids building elaborate structures
and leaping off of barrels.

632
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,465
And I was speechless.

633
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,718
At that point,
I had been working for over a decade

634
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,972
in playground design and material design.

635
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,600
And, to some extent,
like, I had kind of stopped trying

636
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,228
to do something that ideal.

637
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,791
I knew it was possible that children
could do all those things.

638
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:58,818
I didn't know it was possible to let them,

639
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:02,196
because of rules and liability.

640
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,367
The idea that Rigamajig was being
knocked off was really disappointing.

641
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,162
And Doug, my business manager, was like,
"We have to stop them."

642
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,998
But the person who was making it

643
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,961
was different than the person
who was buying it.

644
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,130
And so we realized that
we could be chasing patent infringers

645
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:22,591
or we could try to partner
with the schools.

646
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,648
How's it going?

647
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,275
Yeah?

648
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,444
You're regrouping to go play?

649
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,247
Okay!

650
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,961
After you, my friends.

651
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,842
Very quickly, I went to China
and I learned that

652
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,511
in this region, there were 120 schools

653
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,431
and 14,000 children using this model.

654
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,945
They're outside for two hours a day,

655
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,823
they have these incredible assortment
of materials...

656
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,994
building with these giant blocks,

657
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,663
leaping off of ladders.

658
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:40,544
They decide what they're playing with,
they bring it out, they put it away.

659
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:44,006
The teachers
are really brilliant observers.

660
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:48,094
I shifted from
the initial protective shock,

661
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,388
and I immediately knew that I needed to

662
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:54,475
be involved and learn from what
Ms. Cheng was doing in Anji Play.

663
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,937
Ms. Cheng, she's the founder

664
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,566
and had kind of been developing Anji Play
over the course of 16 years.

665
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,027
And Ms. Cheng is... is a genius.

666
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:10,241
When talking about the relationship

667
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,952
between designers and children,

668
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:16,539
we had a lot in common.

669
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,457
So, we felt like old friends.

670
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,293
So, we asked Cas

671
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,712
to help us

672
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,133
with standardization of Anji Play.

673
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,096
We have been working
to bring Anji Play to the US

674
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,265
and the rest of the world.

675
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,268
I suppose, to some extent,
I'm the design director.

676
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,104
Today, Ms. Cheng pointed out
that the children love

677
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,440
playing with things that are off-balance.

678
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:46,402
And so, I'm thinking about some new ways
that some of the materials or things

679
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,696
could be compatible
with the larger system,

680
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,533
and bring in ways that they can
experiment with balance more.

681
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:57,246
The unstable...
I saw children put the A-frame

682
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,499
or the double ladder
onto one of the barrels.

683
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,378
Yep. Would it be good if the slats
went all the way through?

684
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:08,132
The same way that it might line up
with the climbing cubes?

685
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,801
- ‘Cause that... that would be...
- Yeah.

686
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:14,305
Also, a funny kind of...
I would imagine if it's going this way...

687
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,852
And this would be... Actually,
this would be a good teeter-totter.

688
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,481
The driving ethos
is what we're curious about.

689
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,025
And that's such a big shift

690
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,818
from "What did you learn?"

691
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,154
Right? That there's an outcome,

692
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,531
that there's a thing
that is to be learned,

693
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,533
that we know what can be learned,

694
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,995
and therefore you're out to look for it.

695
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,332
I was watching these girls,
this tire course,

696
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,459
and they pull the tire up there,

697
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,961
and then they roll it down the plank,

698
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,964
and it goes through the... the tube

699
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,134
and then lands into the cube.

700
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,596
And as soon as it got in,
then, of course, like,

701
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,807
what's the point? So, then they keep
making it more and more complicated.

702
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,060
'Cause easy is boring.

703
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:08,859
I do have hope that if you show schools
where this really, really works

704
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,279
and then you get another school to try it
and another school to try it,

705
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,407
that you can get
this kind of contagion effect.

706
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,160
Because you see it in the children.

707
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,456
You see their joy, you see them learning,
you see them growing.

708
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,336
It's not just about children,
that's truly about humanity.

709
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,795
So...

710
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,550
I'm going to be hopeful that we can get,
like, a little bit going,

711
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,928
and, you know, a little bit
can add to a little more of Anji.

712
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,851
I think that design is critical
to our future, and the world.

713
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,230
And all of my designs,
whether it's Rigamajig

714
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:49,400
and the occasional playground design
and project that I do,

715
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,361
Geemo and then with Anji Play,

716
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:57,408
all of them are about empowering
thinking outside of the archetype.

717
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:04,081
I saw it as an opportunity
to have an impact on the future.

718
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,457
I don't... It's funny.

719
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,127
I don't... It's not that I like kids.

720
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,088
I don't dislike kids. I like people.

721
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,715
I am...

722
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,093
I’m sure I'm going to get
some pushback from that, but it's true.

723
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,639
And so, in my mind...

724
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,351
if we can give kids the tools
to build confidence

725
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,061
and have agency and understand

726
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:31,859
how to be creative, empathetic,
good people, then I thoroughly believe

727
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,987
that they will make
a better future for all of us.

728
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,783
If we can play together,
then we can live together.
