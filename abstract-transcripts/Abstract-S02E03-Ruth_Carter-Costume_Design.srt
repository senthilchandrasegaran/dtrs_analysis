1
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:17,475
People assume that I became
a costume designer because I love fashion.

2
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,230
But that wasn't it at all.

3
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,942
My heroes were Langston Hughes,

4
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:30,280
James Baldwin, Nikki Giovanni,
Sonia Sanchez.

5
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,074
Playwrights, poets.

6
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,202
Those were the designers
that inspired me.

7
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,832
People think I sew,
but that's not really what I do.

8
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,669
What I do is I tell stories.

9
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:41,142
When I was first starting out
doing costume design for theater,

10
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:45,063
my mom came to see a play I was doing
and she came backstage afterwards.

11
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,274
She sat in the costume shop

12
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,569
while I gathered the laundry
from the play,

13
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,988
brought it up to the costume shop.

14
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,199
She said, "You mean to tell me

15
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,661
that you graduated with a four-year degree

16
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,413
to come out and do somebody's laundry?"

17
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,712
What is costume design?

18
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,424
Nobody really knows what it is
that we do.

19
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,052
Is it fashion? Do you sew?

20
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:21,683
I mean, they know what lighting design is,
they know what directing is.

21
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,395
I think as we evolved
as a filmmaking body,

22
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,398
there's more focus on it as an art form.

23
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:36,531
For me, costume design
is the process of taking an idea

24
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,284
and making it come to life.

25
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,911
It starts, you know, in here first

26
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,081
and it, is developed.

27
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,003
You have to understand
a little bit about people,

28
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:55,133
what makes a person who they are,

29
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,678
where they live, what they believe in.

30
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,684
Sometimes that's really reflective
on the outside.

31
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,020
It's storytelling.

32
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,738
The best costume design
does this quiet work

33
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,407
of setting the stage for the viewer.

34
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,660
When it's in the hands of someone
like Ruth Carter,

35
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,664
you can't even tell
that she's designing to tell a story.

36
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,084
There's a certain way that Ruth

37
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,794
assembles her costumes

38
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,672
that makes you feel like,
whoever this person is,

39
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,883
that they are indeed the...

40
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,677
the owners of this...
you know, I don't want to say costume,

41
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,264
because I think that the power is
that you don't think of it as "costume."

42
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,708
You think of it as, like,
"This is... this is who they are."

43
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,648
As a director, you wanna
surround yourself with the best people.

44
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,691
The films I've done with Ruth,
it's not like...

45
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,652
you gotta talk all the time.

46
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,279
Nah. We know what we're doing.

47
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,741
And I trust her,
knowing that she's gonna come back

48
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,118
to show me stuff
that's gonna be right on the money.

49
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,499
She makes you feel
good about yourself in those clothes.

50
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,542
You can tell when,

51
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:15,546
she's gotten it right or she feels like
she has it right because she lights up.

52
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,885
What makes Ruth's work
so beautiful is the humanity.

53
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,805
It never feels like costumes, you know.
It just feel like clothes.

54
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,765
Even when it's at its most extravagant,

55
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,936
people are jumping out of airplanes
and fighting big Afrofuturistic battles.

56
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,148
It still feels like something
that these characters put on

57
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,692
and that they wear.

58
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,652
They still felt like people.

59
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,447
That's one of those things when it's like,
"Man, how she do that?" You know?

60
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,955
The very first thing I do
is break down the script.

61
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:56,504
There is a lot of wonderment
in the first reading of the script.

62
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,049
"How are we going to attack this?

63
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:04,929
What is the DP going to want
as far as a color palette?

64
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,475
What's the director thinking of
in terms of these characters,

65
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,311
and what does everybody see?"

66
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,356
One of my favorite projects was Roots.

67
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,736
"We start to hear the pounding of drums.

68
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:24,115
This then becomes the screams of Africans
being taken into slavery.

69
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,993
The waves of the ocean sea join this mix.

70
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,954
Kizzy sees a figure coming towards her
for a moment.

71
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,291
It's clear as day
that it's young Kunta Kinte."

72
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,753
It's just beautifully written.

73
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,049
My job is the... the visual, story.

74
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,344
You know, to bring those textures
and those colors that,

75
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,764
you know, how beautifully this reads
into the story.

76
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:55,271
I think the first initial idea
is very broad.

77
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,068
You want the colors of the scene

78
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,863
to support the words
that are in the script.

79
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,202
The dirt, the drums, and the sea.

80
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,955
The blue indigo of Africa

81
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,335
and Kizzy's hair wrapped
in this natural homespun cloth.

82
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,129
You can feel the color of the earth,

83
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,091
whether it's red clay or brown.

84
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,719
You can kind of really feel the richness
of the scene.

85
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,848
This is like the imagination part
of the process.

86
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,529
The script is just the beginning.

87
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,782
I take that and I expound upon it.

88
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:55,623
Right now, we're in the costume shop
of our film Dolemite Is My Name,

89
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,208
starring Eddie Murphy.

90
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,878
Dolemite is the story of Rudy Ray Moore.

91
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,589
He was a comedian,

92
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,343
and he created his own pimp character
called Dolemite.

93
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,637
Dolemite is my name,

94
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,390
and fuckin' up motherfuckers is my game!

95
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Ooh!

96
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,520
The '70s is such
a personal time for me.

97
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,439
It was when I was a teenager,

98
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,275
and I remember a lot of things about it.

99
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:26,821
So, I'm bringing all of that
to the costumes of the movie.

100
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,117
We knew
that we were going to go really bold.

101
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:36,497
All of our fabrics, and our linings,
and our buttons, and our trims.

102
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,292
And combine them in such a way

103
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,752
where it would really tell this story

104
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,255
of this larger-than-life character.

105
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,052
Then comes the nuts and bolts of,

106
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,221
"What do these ideas really look like?"

107
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:56,434
and "How do I place them in front of me
so that I can realize them?"

108
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,854
There's lots of people that need to know
what your vision is.

109
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,815
And so, the mood boards
help explain all of that.

110
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,153
It's a hodgepodge of fabric swatches,

111
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,322
magazine tear sheets,

112
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,449
illustrations and sketches,

113
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,701
photos from the original movie.

114
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,078
Anything that gives us inspiration.

115
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,499
Everything that Dolemite wore was custom.

116
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,251
I don't wanna get in my car
with this shit on.

117
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,337
I'm glad y'all brought my clothes to me.

118
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:30,051
This happened to be something
close to what Dolomite actually wore.

119
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,638
We'll never really know for sure
what that mesh was.

120
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:37,183
I'm thinking if Dolemite
were to walk in here in that suit,

121
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,102
he'd say, "Man, this is made
out of chain mail."

122
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,771
And I'd go, "What?"

123
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,190
But this is kind of what we used.

124
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,943
It's quieter than chain mail
would have been.

125
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,947
You know, once it's done,
it becomes a wearable garment.

126
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,865
And then, you get the actor in it,

127
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,742
it's very rewarding.

128
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,333
The fitting room is a transformation room.

129
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,129
So you're gonna be in the pimp scene,
so we've gotta get you right.

130
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,967
Let's see you try on this shirt
right here. This green one.

131
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,763
She wants you to be comfortable
in what you're wearing

132
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,891
while you're doing your work,
so that you can do your best work.

133
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,561
He's putting on his pants.

134
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,564
There are times I want to disappear,

135
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:28,734
and there are times I wanna be the thing
that you can't take your eyes off of.

136
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,027
And she gets that.

137
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,821
Turn around, let's see.

138
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:32,905
Ooh.

139
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,074
Transporting into the '70s.

140
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,953
When I put my costume on
and I look at myself,

141
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,580
then I've come to completion.

142
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,749
Yes! There it is.

143
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,169
I think that it's fascinating

144
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,007
how the actor and the character
kind of meld.

145
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,385
Yes, so now you got to stand
with some attitude.

146
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
There we go.

147
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,848
And that's really your job,
and that's what they want you to do.

148
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,016
Collar out.

149
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,225
Done!

150
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,982
I'm looking at things
and how they can be better

151
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,525
and how they can change.

152
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,029
It's like an artist on a painting.
It's never finished.

153
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,281
That's how I feel
about all of my costumes.

154
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,493
You have to see what you don't want
sometimes to know what you want.

155
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,622
And sometimes it's like,
"My God! Wait a minute.

156
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:26,167
Close your coat. Take your shirt out.
Take it out. Hurry up, hurry up.

157
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,710
How much time do I have?"

158
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,964
- Marker!
- Start blocking for rehearsal, guys.

159
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,509
It's never done.
Someone has to just, like, drag me away,

160
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,638
kicking and screaming,
and then they can roll the camera.

161
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,848
- Go ahead. Mark rolling.
- Rolling, rolling.

162
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,604
I really enjoy
recreating the '70s.

163
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,731
The '70s was my era.

164
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,570
Those years of high school,
I was into drama.

165
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,657
I just liked the performing arts a lot.

166
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:02,620
By the time I went to college,
I hung out in the theater department,

167
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,747
and I was acting.

168
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,167
I remember auditioning
for Molière, The Would-Be Gentleman,

169
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,711
and not making the audition.

170
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,006
And the instructor saying, "Do you want
to try doing the costumes?"

171
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,174
So I said, "Okay."

172
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,887
There was no specific study
in costume design,

173
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,682
but I knew how to navigate
around the scripts.

174
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,810
I went to the local fabric store,

175
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,562
bought a bunch of fabric,
got some patterns.

176
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:36,112
That just snowballed into the next
production after the next production.

177
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,782
Before long,
I was the costume designer on campus.

178
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,497
Theater was my first love.

179
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,042
Designing for theater is very different

180
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,628
from designing for film.

181
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,175
With theater, you view things
from the audience

182
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,593
when you're designing it.

183
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,309
There is a certain amount
of texture and color

184
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,938
and things that you don't see
the further away you get from it.

185
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:16,235
So, we make things larger than life,
patterns are sometimes bigger,

186
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:20,614
so that things that you've done
read from the audience.

187
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,911
But in film, because everything
is blown up so large,

188
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:30,416
things that make an impression
are sometimes extreme details.

189
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,378
But film was the last thing
I was really thinking about, you know.

190
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,380
I was really trying
to get a theater project.

191
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,092
In this very theater,

192
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,721
I was, designing the costumes
for this dance company,

193
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:48,726
and it was that show
that introduced Spike to me.

194
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,772
As a director,
you have to be a talent scout.

195
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,316
I was forming a team.
Like, I was general manager.

196
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,319
In sports, you know,
puttin' my team together.

197
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,529
So I needed a costume designer.

198
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,033
He sent me postcards,

199
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,369
inviting me to screenings
to see She's Gotta Have It.

200
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,997
And I was like,
"Nah, put it in the drawer.

201
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,416
Another one from Spike,
put it in the drawer."

202
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,504
Then my friend, who introduced me to him,
called me and said...

203
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,589
"Spike brought his film
She's Gotta Have It

204
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,257
to the Cannes Film Festival."

205
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,801
And I was like, "What?

206
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,678
Why didn't I answer
one of those postcards?"

207
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,975
Someone called me one morning
at, like, five in the morning.

208
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,269
He said, "Ruth." It's like, "Yeah?"

209
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,854
"Ruth?" "Yeah?"

210
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,773
- "Ruth"
- "Yeah?"

211
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,067
"It's the man of your dreams."

212
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,070
I said, "Denzel?"

213
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,531
"No! This is Spike."

214
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,207
Do The Right Thing directive was

215
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:58,712
this film takes place
on the hottest day of the summer.

216
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,007
Shorts, tank tops,

217
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,843
cut-off jeans.

218
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,263
I mean, even look at what Ruth
had Rosie Perez wearing

219
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,056
in the opening credits sequence.

220
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,559
All that stuff that Rosie's wearing
while she's dancing,

221
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,102
that's... that's Ruth Carter.

222
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,062
Do The Right Thing is the film

223
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,732
that single-handedly made
hip-hop fashion a thing.

224
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,027
The reds, the blacks,
the greens, the yellows,

225
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,948
that are really mimicking
various West African flags.

226
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,118
It was very prevalent in Brooklyn

227
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:33,372
to have a connection to your culture,
and to Africa,

228
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,416
and to wear kente shorts,

229
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:39,920
and to have necklaces
with the continent of Africa.

230
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,757
And we wanted to make
these African crop tops

231
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,759
and African shorts.

232
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:52,308
We wanted to sort of show how
pop culture responds to the inner city.

233
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,269
She's using
this vibrant color palette

234
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,688
as a color palette of protest.

235
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,650
That's why the costumes
in Do The Right Thing are so important,

236
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,652
because they help us understand

237
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,487
the politics of the space

238
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,325
that most viewers in middle America
had never really experienced.

239
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,328
The moment when John Savage,

240
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,664
wearing a Larry Bird
Boston Celtics T-shirt,

241
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:20,336
accidentally steps
on Buggin' Out's new pristine Jordans?

242
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,544
Yo!

243
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,590
That's part of the culture.
I mean, like...

244
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,674
Yo!

245
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,093
It's why that movie
still persists

246
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,095
as one of the most influential

247
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,307
films on race relations
in 20th-century America.

248
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,479
Hollywood wasn't used
to the Spike Lees of the world.

249
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,982
He wanted to show black people on camera,
in cinema,

250
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,110
in more of a realistic manner.

251
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,447
We didn't have images of ourselves

252
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,199
that were positive.

253
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,618
I grew up looking at, um,

254
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,079
all of those old black-and-white films.

255
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,460
Birth of a Nation
was one of the first films.

256
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:06,715
And it was so derogatory
towards African-Americans.

257
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,843
There's this white man
running around in blackface,

258
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:14,807
and this woman screaming
and running from him, like he's a beast.

259
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:21,188
And, um, you know, other movies we were
either tap dancing or serving someone.

260
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,816
I think the '60s
started to change that,

261
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,609
but it was very slow.

262
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,654
And we went through blaxploitation,

263
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,907
where we were pimps, and drug dealers,
and prostitutes.

264
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,761
I've got ten of the finest hoes
in the world working for me.

265
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,579
I'm gettin' a hundred dollars a day
from each one. Okay?

266
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,919
We are tasked
with the responsibility to rewrite that.

267
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,968
I was raised in a small town,
Springfield, Mass.

268
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,681
When I look around
my old childhood library,

269
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,768
it still feels like this place
where I can come

270
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,898
and just lose myself in history,
and poetry,

271
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:09,486
and just whatever it is
that I'm trying to learn about.

272
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,322
And the possibilities are just endless.

273
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,494
This library happened to be
across the street from my high school.

274
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,164
This was the hooky spot.

275
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,878
Nobody ever really questioned me
for being in here.

276
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,923
Even if it was two in the afternoon,
I could be in the library.

277
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,135
Just escaping.

278
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,388
We always wanted to be conscious.

279
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,809
So, reading about slavery
or knowing about civil rights

280
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:45,439
was an easy entry point
for me as a young person.

281
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,153
I like to feel like my costumes

282
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,490
are supporting a greater story.

283
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,660
The story of the times
and the story of the person.

284
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:03,916
And I like to feel
that they have a breath to them.

285
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,297
It was a natural progression for me

286
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,717
to be on films that had me research.

287
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,554
What were the colors of the time?

288
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,349
What were the economics of the time?

289
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,978
Once you understand the world
that a character lives in,

290
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:29,191
you can support that part of the story
with your design.

291
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,739
Malcolm X was the first film
that I'd done that, um,

292
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,157
went through so many eras.

293
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,326
He was so multi-faceted

294
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,578
with all the things
that he did in his life.

295
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,458
Researching New York in the '40s
was wonderful.

296
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,002
Harlem was alive, it was buzzing.

297
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:53,924
And so you really wanted to bring in
that sense of the heartbeat of Harlem.

298
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,303
There were certain areas
that were really broad.

299
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,180
Those were the zoot suits.

300
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,016
Zoot suits were considered
a hoodlum fashion.

301
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,101
Roseland!

302
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,645
The dance sequence in the film.

303
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,105
Those zoot suits.

304
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,898
That was... That was amazing.

305
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:14,069
I researched exactly
what the length of the coat was,

306
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,363
how narrow the pant was,

307
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,075
what kind of chains went around,
what kind of pocket watch,

308
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,119
how long the feather would be,

309
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,955
so that we could really get a true sense

310
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,958
of what a zoot suit
looked and felt like to wear.

311
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,337
From there, we took the journey

312
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,924
to his gangster days
in the '40s and the '50s.

313
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,428
And then we go from there
to incarceration.

314
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,640
I went to the Department of Correction

315
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,436
and I asked them
if I could see Malcolm X's files.

316
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,023
I had medical records,

317
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,192
his booking photo,

318
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,570
and I had quite a few letters
that he had written.

319
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:01,241
And I noticed
how his penmanship changed

320
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,995
and his grammar increased
as he educated himself.

321
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,543
When he came out of prison, he was humble.

322
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,089
I connected to that moment
with his costume.

323
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:22,971
He was bent over
in this rumpled, oversized suit.

324
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,100
He was not that cocky gangster anymore.

325
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:32,064
I feel it's a big responsibility
to dress these big iconic figures,

326
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,608
because people... know them.

327
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,610
They feel endeared to them.

328
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:41,114
You have to actually honor them
with your artistry.

329
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,284
Sometimes, when you watch a film,

330
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,120
it's supposed to represent
something real and true,

331
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,123
but then you kind of only get
the film version of it.

332
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,419
She always makes a point
to bring out the realness.

333
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,339
The humanitarian aspect
of her costume design,

334
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,383
and the meticulousness of her choices

335
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:03,595
give the person that's being depicted
this kind of dignity,

336
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,473
where historically, you know,
that was lacking that.

337
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:11,270
I looked at the cargo list
that was on the real Amistad,

338
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:15,190
and I saw that there were blankets
and there was cloth.

339
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:21,071
You know, I felt like these were Africans
that came from different communities.

340
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,492
They would maybe cover their hair,
wrap turbans.

341
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,788
As they arrived,
they were brought to jail.

342
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:34,459
We managed to keep the American flag
kind of wrapped on one of the guys' heads,

343
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,462
as if he's unaware of what that means.

344
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:42,259
And in one of the writings
of the Amistad case,

345
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,971
it said that in the courtroom,
they looked like doves.

346
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,142
And so, I gave them all
these clean white shirts

347
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,520
to sort of give them
that dove-like appearance.

348
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,489
You know, I don't like to rely
on what my subconscious tells me

349
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,993
because I think it's usually wrong.

350
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,706
I love these, runaway slave ads.

351
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,167
Ten-dollar reward for Tabitha.

352
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,337
"Tabitha is about
five feet two or three inches high,

353
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,881
dark yellow complexion, stout made,

354
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,051
common head of hair,
and about 20 years of age."

355
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,096
I like the people that I read about.

356
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,352
And I really want to see them
resurrected in some ways.

357
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:39,358
So, I work really hard to try
to get those details on, an actor.

358
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,612
I think that there hasn't been enough

359
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,198
study of African-American history.

360
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:50,285
And the way that we tell the stories

361
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,746
sometimes is through movies.

362
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:56,792
And it's important
that we take responsibility for it and...

363
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,460
and, um...

364
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,047
bring to life, as best we can, the truth.

365
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,515
There's eight of us in my family.

366
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,392
I'm the youngest.

367
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,854
- Roy was three years older than me.
- Yeah. I was working.

368
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,982
I used to go in your room
and you used to hate that.

369
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,150
- Yeah.
- Why?

370
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:26,238
I still don't know why, to this day, Roy,
why you hated me in your room.

371
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,864
Because it was my stuff.

372
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,619
Ma, what kind of kid was I?

373
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,914
- A nice daughter.
- ! I'm glad.

374
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,834
Ma used to drive us all to school,

375
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,546
and then you'd drive up the hill
to Springfield Technical Community College

376
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,880
and go to your class.

377
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,592
I was puttin'...
I was puttin' emphasis on education then.

378
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:51,179
I wish I could have went to school
a little longer. I like...

379
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,014
I like school.

380
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,187
The thing I believe that my mom
instilled in me is this empathy,

381
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,565
this great empathy for people.

382
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:06,528
You know, because of the psychology
that my mom studied

383
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,697
and brought home every day,

384
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:15,245
I got to take a deep dive
into why people are the way they are.

385
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:19,416
You know, I'm grateful for her
for teaching us that empathy.

386
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:24,713
That's probably why I see
the things I see in characters.

387
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,386
This is the old machine
that was in my room.

388
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,763
By day, it was a desk,

389
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,641
and, by night, I guess,

390
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,101
it was a sewing machine.

391
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,227
It had a cool light.

392
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:44,816
I also, when I left, I guess, for school,
I wrote a sign.

393
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,028
So, while I was away,
nobody would get rid of it. I...

394
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,030
I was endeared to this machine.

395
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,616
It says, "This machine belongs
to Ruth E. Carter.

396
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,035
Do not throw it away, sell it, or keep it.

397
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,037
Thank you. It's mine."

398
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:02,083
I remember I sewed
a big, fluffy, orange vest

399
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,711
that I wore to one of my friends' parties.

400
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,880
And she asked me, you know,
"Did you make that?"

401
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,173
And I said, "Yeah.

402
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,673
I made it."

403
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:17,599
I had a knack for creating stuff
out of nothing.

404
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,481
Going from junior high school
to high school,

405
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,692
I decided I wanted to be a Muslim.

406
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:33,490
So, I took my pants and I opened them up
and I made 'em into long skirts,

407
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,242
and I covered my hair.

408
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,619
And I started studying the Koran.

409
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,121
And people thought I was deep, you know?

410
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,126
I'd do the little praying to the east,

411
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,671
and people gave me a little distance,

412
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:51,007
because I had a purpose and I had an aura.

413
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,595
Eleventh grade,
it all went out the window.

414
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,682
I went to the other school
that was up the street.

415
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:05,897
I just remember going to this new
high school with this totally new look.

416
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:10,944
High boots, and long gauchos, and a vest,

417
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,405
and blouses, and a briefcase.

418
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,908
I remember a couple of kids in the hallway

419
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,744
asking me if I was, like,
a substitute teacher.

420
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,249
You know, I was no longer the Muslim girl.

421
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,002
I was the... you know, the businesswoman.

422
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:31,423
And then, that way,
I put on these personas.

423
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,135
When we try on clothes in a store,

424
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:39,431
we get excited
because they're brand new and fresh.

425
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:44,269
You walk out of the store
with your new item in your shopping bag,

426
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,273
and then you get home and you're like,
"What was I thinking?

427
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,443
This doesn't look at all like who I am."

428
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,153
Or, "I feel silly."

429
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,573
You're really talking about character.

430
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:06,583
One of the ways I get ideas
is to go out into the street

431
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,168
and observe people.

432
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,213
Especially when I'm in New York.

433
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,550
I just love to go people-watching.

434
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,678
I look at people's clothes,

435
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,181
how they carry themselves,

436
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:25,268
and I make up stories in my head
about their lives,

437
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,729
and it's all based on what I see.

438
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:32,901
These are the people
that bring the ideas to my work.

439
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:39,324
Clothing can tell you so much
about a person.

440
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,788
You know, if they're a mother,
or if they're an artist.

441
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:50,460
That informs you
about what their footwear looks like.

442
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,420
The age of their clothes.

443
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:56,549
The expense of their clothes.
What's their economic status?

444
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,885
What do they care about?

445
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,639
All those things work out
on the clothes.

446
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,975
It's part of a bigger picture.

447
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,825
Maybe if we take a little bit less
of the research

448
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:25,995
and, kind of create our own lines
down the sides there.

449
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,708
Once I have my ideas,
I'll do a rough sketch

450
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:34,003
and I'll take my ideas over
to a digital illustrator.

451
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,715
I think it needs to have
a little bit of a train.

452
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,050
- Okay.
- We should probably add a train to it.

453
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,885
If we get a little bit more dramatic there

454
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,681
and then add some more
of the elements of the shield.

455
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,309
It's up to you to kind of inform them
about detail.

456
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,688
That's the great part,
because they're really wonderful artists.

457
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,274
And they make you look really good.

458
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,609
It's a very
collaborative process

459
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,154
in which we're able to work,
but also back up the designer

460
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,823
to figure out what's going on
in... in their head,

461
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,242
and try and get it out
to everybody else.

462
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,037
- Which is, an art form all in itself.
- Yeah.

463
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,083
Are you trying to say
that there's a lot in my head?

464
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,417
Yeah.

465
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:19,007
- And I got to get it out of there.
- Yeah. I help. I help.

466
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,008
A lot.

467
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,469
Beauty is a subjective thing.

468
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:26,765
I need it to look like
what I'm feeling in my soul.

469
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:30,477
And when it doesn't feel that way,
we have to change it.

470
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:39,778
For us, as artists, we have to create this
into a design that's wearable.

471
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,321
It's wearable art.

472
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:46,659
You have to be able to foresee
what the problems could possibly be

473
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,329
with the materials that you chose.

474
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:53,583
It can be really scary,
because time is money

475
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,753
and you don't want to go down
the wrong road.

476
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,297
There's so many details to the vision.

477
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:03,051
And the bigger the project,
the more challenging it gets.

478
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,644
Any time you have to create a world,

479
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,772
it's a huge, monumental task.

480
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,569
When people say,
"Wow, she designed the Black Panther.

481
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,238
Tell me how your process is."

482
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,658
I'm like, "Yeah! I go home
and cry in my pillow every night

483
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,201
because I'm scared."

484
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:35,625
I think it was because of the level
of stress, the level of responsibility.

485
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:39,045
You know, I hadn't done
a superhero film before.

486
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:43,424
In a film like Panther,
it's as complex as it can get.

487
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,970
But, I'm a football player. Man, like,
you know, I came up playing football.

488
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,513
We would call somebody like Ruth...

489
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,431
um, like, we said they had
good footwork.

490
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,075
Kind of light-footed. Know what I mean?

491
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,603
Like, she's able to transition in ways
that it's almost seamless. You know?

492
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:02,652
Before the Black Panther,
I had small exercises in fantasy

493
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,487
and futuristic ideas.

494
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:13,621
And one thing that I did
o research what would be the future

495
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,290
was to look at the past.

496
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,043
Which is what I also did
with Black Panther,

497
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,422
looking at the ancient indigenous tribes
around Africa.

498
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:28,052
And Africa being
this vast resource of artistic ideas,

499
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:32,056
it's kind of fun
to sort of reimagine things.

500
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,810
Clothing, you know,
it's a form of expression.

501
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,439
When you see people in a film,
that's the first thing, usually,

502
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,774
that you get out of them,
it's what they're wearing.

503
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,018
You're not thinkin' about it.

504
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,695
You're waitin' for them to talk
or for them to do a action

505
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,488
that's gonna tell you something
about them.

506
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,490
But... but, you know,
that first impression

507
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,658
is what they have on.

508
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,161
When you meet Killmonger in this film,

509
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,804
you know, as soon as you see him,
you get a little bit of a read.

510
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,664
Good morning.

511
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,207
He's wearing western clothing.

512
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,091
He's got the denim jacket on
with the black...

513
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,170
It feels contemporary,
of the moment. Um...

514
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,922
You kind of clocking all those things.

515
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,133
And I think when it's...
when it's working at its best,

516
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,385
you know, costume is... is...
is giving you information

517
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,762
about the character

518
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,722
in a way that serves as a story.

519
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,146
When can we get this done?

520
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,148
You can pick any fabric

521
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,400
and they'll make up anything
that you want.

522
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:30,198
African fabrics are actually brought
to Africa by the Dutch.

523
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,993
And since we were trying to imagine
Wakanda before it was colonized,

524
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,829
we tried to create
our own patterns and things.

525
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,498
And then, I mixed in a lot of this,

526
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,416
so, for the color and...

527
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,918
You know, this says Africa.

528
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,921
So, regardless, it does say Africa.

529
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,841
But I was very careful
about where I used it.

530
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,303
These are from Mali, the Tuareg.

531
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,057
These are mostly, like,
around South Africa, the amber.

532
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,225
They use a lot of it.

533
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,688
We came to places like this
to purchase a lot of pieces we used

534
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,106
in the Warrior Falls.

535
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,862
A big theme for me was
his concept of what it means to be African

536
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,031
and how colonization has affected that.

537
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,742
You know, we wanted to really define
the ethnic groups of Wakanda.

538
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,453
You know, and kind of
steep them in real...

539
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,580
you know, real ethnic groups
from the continent.

540
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,211
The Dora Milaje
was the fan favorite.

541
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,342
There were so many things
in that costume

542
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,344
that had significance to Africa

543
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:39,017
and to creating them as the highest
ranking female fighting force of Wakanda.

544
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:45,064
The printing of their bodysuit
has this special raised print

545
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,941
to look like scarification.

546
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,196
Their neck rings and arm rings were taken
from the Ndebele tribe of South Africa.

547
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,034
And the overall color of red
was taken from the Maasai

548
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,077
and many other tribes of Africa.

549
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:03,041
On the tabard,
there are small, trinkets.

550
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:07,670
And these trinkets represented
what tribe they hailed from.

551
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,881
I kind of added that,

552
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,674
so that each of the Dora

553
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:15,011
would have something
that individualized them.

554
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,555
You want it to feel real.

555
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:21,350
You want it to portray a certain amount
of dignity and cultural specificity.

556
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,729
And some of it, you're pulling
from real people that exist in the world,

557
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,023
and other bits of it,
you're kind of totally inventing.

558
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:32,820
We were able to infuse
cultural and African diaspora

559
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,491
with the realm of fantasy and future,

560
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:40,912
and keep it within the realm
of what the fans knew about Black Panther.

561
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,083
And we needed, like...
We, the black folks,

562
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,544
needed a movie like that
where there were black heroes.

563
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:53,007
It's still kind of, you know, inspiring,
especially for young kids.

564
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,220
The Black Panther stands alongside

565
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,306
many films that were addressing

566
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:03,893
those issues of dispelling
negative stereotypes

567
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,853
and moving the culture forward.

568
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,370
As much as I love being a designer,

569
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,414
there are sacrifices
that come along with it.

570
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,627
You are traveling three months
in one city,

571
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,130
and then you're back in another.

572
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:38,177
And so, it's really hard to cultivate
long-standing relationships.

573
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,474
I met my husband in a hair salon.

574
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,435
Mario Jackson.

575
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,397
Snag was his nickname.

576
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,607
His street name.

577
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:59,031
When I first met my husband,
I didn't know he had gang affiliations.

578
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,828
He was charming, he was witty,
he was funny.

579
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:07,707
He was a regular guy,
but, you know, he grew up in the Crips.

580
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,003
And as an adult, it's something
that just kind of never leaves you.

581
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,722
On Baby Boy,
he told me everything.

582
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,599
Some nice shoes.

583
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,435
How they would wear
the Stacy Adams,

584
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,979
how they would crease their pants,

585
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,482
what type of Wrangler jeans would be worn,

586
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,611
how the T-shirt would fit at the neck,

587
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,030
what sizes I should buy,

588
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,365
what kinds of belts I should buy,

589
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,826
what a Romeo was,

590
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,037
where I should go and buy them.

591
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:52,376
All of those terms were defined for me
right there in my own house.

592
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:58,174
You know, it wasn't easy
being married to Snag.

593
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,386
He didn't invite that world into our home,

594
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:06,140
um, but he did, keep
an active group of friends

595
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:10,394
that came from there
that he knew all of his life.

596
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,320
That day, he was going out
to meet some friends.

597
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:23,282
I remember standing in the driveway
as he was leaving,

598
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,661
and then he stopped
before he got in the car

599
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,331
and he came back up the driveway
and he gave me a kiss,

600
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,083
and then he drove off.

601
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,670
That was the last time I saw him.

602
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:45,596
That day, I went and got a canvas.
I was going to paint in the backyard.

603
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:52,561
I saw this picture of this woman
with her hands outstretched, looking up.

604
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:57,858
I started painting this canvas
and just kind of getting into the subject.

605
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,907
It was, like, ten o'clock at night,

606
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,278
and I thought,
"Well, yeah, I haven't heard from him."

607
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,290
Someone called me
and they said, "Ruth."

608
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:18,045
And the way they said, "Ruth," I...

609
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,172
kind of knew.

610
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:26,804
They were watching a boxing match
in a respectable bar.

611
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,308
Remaining undefeated...

612
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,395
And the guy came in,

613
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,188
he pulled a gun out,

614
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,941
killed my husband's best friend,

615
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,736
and then shot my husband seven times.

616
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,199
Basically, out of jealousy,

617
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,493
because he had changed his life

618
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,412
and moved on.

619
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,667
My feet just weighed a ton.

620
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:01,464
My feet were like cinder blocks.

621
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:05,426
I could barely pick my feet up
to walk in there.

622
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,140
I know it sounds strange,

623
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,642
but after that happened

624
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,020
and he was freed,

625
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,938
it freed me, too.

626
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,983
And I didn't have the weight
of his life anymore.

627
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:25,196
You know, that's when life began
for me again.

628
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,966
I had been searching
for a spiritual practice.

629
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,594
Going to church never connected.

630
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:52,098
Doing meditation just wasn't enough.

631
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,601
And then, Oprah was on set one day.

632
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:01,565
We were in the middle of Louisiana,
in the bayou,

633
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,192
way out somewhere.

634
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,195
And she just said,
"You know, art is prayer.

635
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,656
It's just God speaking through you."

636
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,201
And that just hit me like a ton of bricks.

637
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:18,040
Because I was like, "Wow!
Did she just say art is prayer? Like...

638
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,084
I can totally see that."

639
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,296
When you zone out
on something that you're working on,

640
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,424
it's creative,

641
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,592
it's imaginative,

642
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,594
it's restorative.

643
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,264
Why wouldn't it be prayer?

644
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,438
I'm gonna take me seriously.

645
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,771
Now.

646
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,816
I have taken school,

647
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:48,320
parents, friends, poets seriously.

648
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,824
I've known the cracker
to be seriously dangerous.

649
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:56,370
I've taken daytime,
nighttime rhetoric seriously,

650
00:40:56,454 --> 00:41:00,958
and been wounded by lovers
of slick, black rapping.

651
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,879
I'm gonna look in a mirror
each time I pass one

652
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:09,550
and smile at my image, sayin',
"Yeah, sister, it ain't easy,

653
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,303
but move beautifully on past it.

654
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,472
Keep holdin' your head higher,

655
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,807
'cause your best is yet to come."

656
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,059
I'm gonna take me seriously.

657
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,811
Today. Now.

658
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,188
And study myself.

659
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,982
Get a PhD in Ruth Carter

660
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,902
and dare anyone
to be an authority on me.

661
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,363
'Cause I'll be wounded with Ruth's beauty,

662
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,573
learning,

663
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,574
love,

664
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,659
and will be dangerous.

665
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,913
I'm gonna be serious about me

666
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,623
and live.

667
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,712
Yeah.

668
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,429
There's a little bit of a dust
on his...

669
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,139
right there on his shoulder.

670
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:01,685
So, you might want to help her,
because the collar is a little off center.

671
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,104
Okay, let's... let's move on
to the trench coats.

672
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,814
How are we gonna do that?

673
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,153
Black Panther put everything
that I've ever done on a pedestal.

674
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:16,534
And I think that's really nice,
to be able to re-introduce your work.

675
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,580
Just look at it as a body of work, now.

676
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,305
This is the first time I've ever seen
all those costumes together in one room.

677
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,063
This is great. This is really great.

678
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,360
A lot of great, great memories here.

679
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:56,657
A lot of really, really important work.

680
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:01,453
And a lot of great times
with a lot of great people.

681
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:10,462
It's very interesting that people
are just now kind of catching on to Ruth.

682
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,174
Her work has this presence of, like,
"My God!" Like...

683
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,678
You mean, like, one of those Picasso type
of... You know what I mean? Like it's...

684
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,472
Her legacy’s, like,
so, so much bigger than she is.

685
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,436
We've seen this woman,
over the course of her career,

686
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,482
learn how to bring that humanity,
that emotionality

687
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,318
to life through her clothes

688
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,654
in a way that is
not only historically accurate,

689
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,325
but that can imagine possibilities
for black lives

690
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,411
that the history books
have told us wasn't possible.

691
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,457
We go to the movies
to be entertained

692
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,792
and to be educated in some ways.

693
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,421
So, it's a big part of our culture. It...

694
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,757
It stamps our place in time.

695
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,803
If I am tasked
with this great responsibility

696
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,640
of dressing a culture,

697
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,392
I want to spur it even further

698
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,895
than people have done in the past.

699
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,737
I am so overwhelmed with joy.

700
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,907
Ladies and gentlemen, we made it.

701
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,285
Can you believe
this night is finally here?

702
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,048
When I look back,

703
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:41,095
I see a little bit of a different me
with each film.

704
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,059
It feels like I am here.

705
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,938
That I have connected to...

706
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,648
my voice.
