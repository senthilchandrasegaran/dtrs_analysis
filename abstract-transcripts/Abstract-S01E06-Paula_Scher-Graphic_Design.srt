[Paula] <i>I walk outside</i>
<i>and I see typography everywhere.</i>

2
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,896
<i>New York City is a city of signs.</i>

3
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,361
<i>Sometimes things written by hand,</i>

4
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,069
<i>mismatched,</i>

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,160
<i>hung up in some peculiar way.</i>

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,540
<i>You think, "Oh my God, can I get up there</i>
<i>and please readjust that sign?</i>

7
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,538
<i>That's just absolutely awful!"</i>

8
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:41,424
<i>The way numbers are on doors.</i>
<i>No two the same down the block.</i>

9
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,554
<i>All messages are different,</i>
<i>and they're everywhere.</i>

10
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,798
<i>Typography is painting with words.</i>

11
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,682
<i>That's my biggest high.</i>

12
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,559
It's my crack.

13
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,139
[funky music playing]

00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,940
[Lupton] <i>Paula Scher</i>
<i>is the goddess of graphic design.</i>

15
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,238
<i>Her stuff is everywhere!</i>

16
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,621
[Bierut] <i>Paula's been able to come up with</i>

17
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:23,165
<i>more ways to make type talk</i>
<i>than anyone else,</i>

18
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,380
<i>and to create a distinctive body of work</i>
<i>just with letters.</i>

19
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,312
[Paula] <i>When I go to work every day,</i>

20
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:27,229
<i>I feel like I'm navigating myself</i>
<i>through a maze.</i>

21
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,734
-Hey.
-[colleague] How are you?

22
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,698
Look at this! A real type book!

23
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,736
-Can you bring this to Courtney?
-[colleague] Yeah.

24
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,235
[Paula] <i>I sit nose to nose</i>
<i>with my partners.</i>

25
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,868
<i>My team is on the fourth floor.</i>

26
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,214
<i>I have to run up and down steps</i>
<i>to see them.</i>

27
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,040
I actually like this.
I think you should move 'em lower.

28
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,753
<i>It's very quick paced.</i>

29
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,956
You're seeing something
that looks like this.

30
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,297
<i>I'm solving things on scraps of paper.</i>

31
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,143
<i>Starting something, getting interrupted...</i>

32
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,509
-[colleague] Paula?
-Yeah?

33
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,135
<i>The interruption is great.</i>

34
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:04,182
I like the way the icons
also interrelate with the thing.

35
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,597
<i>Pentagram is a design cooperative.</i>

36
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,556
There's the benefit of a large firm,

37
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,937
but everybody gets to act
like they're an individual.

38
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,070
<i>There's no boss. Just friends.</i>

39
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,414
[Bierut] <i>Pentagram's a supergroup</i>
<i>of the most famous designers in the world</i>

40
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,240
<i>doing the best work in the world.</i>

41
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:25,365
It's like an all-star team, and Paula is
the indispensable player on that team.

42
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,786
That one's my favorite so far.

43
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,424
[Bierut] <i>We all have</i>
<i>our own individual style,</i>

44
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,842
<i>individual way of working.</i>

45
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,554
[Paula] <i>I could never walk into an office</i>
<i>and sit down at my desk to design,</i>

46
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,934
<i>I would accomplish nothing.</i>

47
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,931
<i>I can sit down at my desk</i>
<i>to read my e-mail.</i>

48
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,814
<i>You go through your junk mail...</i>

49
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,730
A lot of crap.

50
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,228
<i>You throw it all out,</i>
<i>you make a little order on your desk,</i>

51
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,811
<i>and then you go, "Oh, my God,</i>
<i>how am I going to solve this problem?"</i>

52
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,278
<i>Then, you walk up the stairs,</i>

53
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,569
<i>go into the ladies' room,</i>
<i>put on your lipstick and figure it out.</i>

54
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:02,697
[colleague] It's...

55
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,624
I love it like that. It's very slurpy.

56
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,504
-Slurpy, yeah.
-Don't you think?

57
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,541
Yeah, I like that.

58
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,999
[Paula] <i>Ideas can be triggered</i>
<i>by working with my team.</i>

59
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,245
[Paula] ...optical illusion.

60
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,756
<i>I see more than I would see</i>
<i>if I was just doing it all by myself.</i>

61
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,970
<i>It's fantastic.</i>

62
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:22,137
I think that you have to make
"Girls" and "Boys" the same weight,

63
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,390
with the exception of the pointy things.

64
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,733
And then figure out
how the other type intersects.

65
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,559
And then we gotta figure out color.

66
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:34,442
<i>We're working on the Summer Festival</i>
<i>posters for the Public Theater.</i>

67
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:38,154
They put on free Shakespeare
in Central Park every summer.

68
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:43,366
So, like here it says,
<i>Taming of the Shrew </i>inside the wrap.

69
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,660
You don't have to do that work
with the whole name.

70
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,914
You're putting this
in a kind of lozenge shape.

71
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,246
-I think it'll be cool.
-Yeah, it looks really fun.

72
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,082
So, give it a shot!

73
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,797
<i>I've been designing</i>
<i>for the Public Theater since 1994.</i>

74
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,597
<i>My first project was</i>
<i>creating an identity for the Theater.</i>

75
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,226
<i>When they hired me,</i>
<i>they had a name issue.</i>

76
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,647
[Wolfe] <i>One of the things</i>
<i>that was very challenging</i>

77
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,479
about the Public Theater,
it had multiple identities:

78
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,614
it was the Public Theater,

79
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,281
<i>and then some people called it</i>
<i>the Joseph Papp Public Theater,</i>

80
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,361
<i>and then there was</i>
<i>Shakespeare in Central Park.</i>

81
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,283
I wanted everything
to feel like it was of one.

82
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,327
<i>That it was breathing fully</i>
<i>as an institution.</i>

83
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,252
[Paula] <i>It had to be populous.</i>

84
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:36,171
I knew it had to be New Yorkish,
meaning it had to be loud and proud.

85
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:45,387
I was flipping through one of my books

86
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,060
on American wood type.

87
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:53,228
I like American wood type because
it's powerful, and it has many forms.

88
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,437
On this particular page were these Rs,

89
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,404
and they go back to the skinniest form
or to the widest form,

90
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:07,236
and I realized I could make the word
"Public" in the same kind of weights,

91
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,535
and it would symbolize all of New York.

92
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,540
Every type of weight was included.

93
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,923
<i>You can create</i>
<i>an identity for a whole place</i>

94
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,053
<i>based on a recognizability of type.</i>

95
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:29,558
[Wolfe] <i>Paula's work pulled people in.</i>
<i>You instantly knew, "The Public."</i>

96
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:35,310
<i>It's a language that could be dissected,</i>
<i>taken apart, put back together.</i>

97
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,015
That's one the things
I think is thrilling about it.

98
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,943
[Paula] <i>Typography can create</i>
<i>immense power.</i>

99
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,738
<i>You're working with things</i>
<i>that create character.</i>

100
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,493
<i>You're working with weight.</i>

101
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,535
<i>You're working with height.</i>

102
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,664
<i>If you take an E,</i>

103
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,787
<i>and the middle bar is the same length</i>
<i>as the ends of the E's,</i>

104
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:01,876
<i>it feels different than if the little bar</i>
<i>is half the length of the E's.</i>

105
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,679
<i>If you lift the little bar up higher,</i>

106
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,969
<i>it will make the typeface look</i>
<i>like it was drawn in the 1930s.</i>

107
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,715
<i>The same thing as</i>
<i>if you drop the middle bar lower,</i>

108
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,477
<i>it will look moderne.</i>

109
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:19,359
<i>If a font is heavy and bold,</i>
<i>it may give you a feeling of immediacy.</i>

110
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,779
<i>If a font is thin and has a serif form,</i>
<i>it may feel classical.</i>

111
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:30,368
So that, before you even read it,
you have sensibility and spirit.

112
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,911
And that, if you combine that
with a meaning,

113
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,036
<i>then that's spectacular.</i>

114
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,000
<i>When I did the High Line logo,</i>

115
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,667
<i>the goal was to make it look more like</i>
<i>a railroad track than an H.</i>

116
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,139
<i>If you take the kind of weight that</i>
<i>might make the line for a railroad track,</i>

117
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,180
<i>and you put two horizontal bars across it,</i>

118
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,305
<i>it begins to look fairly industrial.</i>

119
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,153
<i>It totally changes the spirit</i>

120
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,939
<i>without having to create</i>
<i>any kind of illustrative narrative.</i>

121
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,705
<i>I used to paint my fonts by hand,</i>
<i>when I was a young designer,</i>

122
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,546
<i>and I really miss it.</i>

123
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,885
<i>When we became fully computerized</i>
<i>in the late '90s,</i>

124
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,970
<i>I didn't touch anything</i>
<i>and I didn't use my hands.</i>

125
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:39,516
In the past, I cut things up,
I ripped things, I pasted things.

126
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,227
<i>I touched art supplies.</i>

127
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:47,653
<i>That physical loss was huge for me,</i>
<i>and that's why I started painting.</i>

128
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,106
Uh-oh. That's Utah.

129
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,777
<i>I deliberately began painting the maps</i>

130
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,577
<i>because they would take me</i>
<i>a long time to accomplish,</i>

131
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,912
<i>in some very rote way,</i>

132
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,418
<i>and that's actually everything</i>
<i>that went away.</i>

133
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:08,341
These dotted lines are the distances
between two given points

134
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,133
and the background is the zip codes.

135
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,433
It's not factual, it's emotional.

136
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,352
Like Wyoming doesn't have
very many people in it,

137
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,432
but you feel it instead of know it.

138
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:27,608
<i>I'm not making</i>
<i>something designed to answer questions,</i>

139
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,362
<i>it's more a design to raise them.</i>

140
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,410
This painting is
counties and zip codes.

141
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,373
<i>Why do some little states</i>
<i>have a million counties,</i>

142
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,463
<i>and some big states have very few?</i>

143
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,213
Now this one is a demographic map:

144
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,924
<i>average age of people,</i>
<i>racial and ethnic breakdowns.</i>

145
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,888
<i>To actually have any sense of it,</i>
<i>you actually have to sit and read it.</i>

146
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,808
But, the information is
equivalently complicated and ridiculous.

147
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,646
I used to make complicated,
nonsensical charts

148
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,735
and diagrams that were satirical.

149
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,533
<i>Silly information. Fractured information.</i>

150
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,907
<i>And I did it to make points.</i>

151
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:25,286
<i>Then I started charting</i>
<i>things that were not chartable.</i>

152
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,882
<i>Mostly denigrating</i>
<i>my own physical appearance.</i>

153
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,510
<i>I find it funny.</i>

154
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,641
<i>Sometimes they're pithy</i>
<i>and more meaningful,</i>

155
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,388
<i>like all my numbers on my credit cards,</i>

156
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,181
<i>just to show how many numbers</i>
<i>were attached to my name</i>

157
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,266
<i>and they're</i>
<i>in some computer somewhere.</i>

158
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,230
<i>Later, they became political.</i>

159
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,403
<i>Or nonsensical.</i>

160
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,937
<i>Ultimately, it turned into my paintings.</i>

161
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,534
That one has a period,
maybe they should have periods.

[director] So Paula, these paintings,

163
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,787
they seem to have
a little obsessional quality to them.

164
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,542
Yeah, I think they're quite obsessive.

This one needs to be stronger over here.

<i>called quantitative reasoning.</i>

<i>My family thought it was going to be Math,</i>

170
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,765
but it wasn't.

171
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,441
It was the ability to synthesize a lot
of information

172
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,810
and come to a conclusion.

<i>I mean, I was</i>
<i>a person who went to art classes</i>

184
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,089
<i>instead of going to the football games.</i>

185
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,178
<i>There's something wrong with you</i>
<i>if you do that.</i>

186
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,733
<i>Then I was at the Tyler School of Art</i>
<i>studying Illustration,</i>

187
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,573

<i>in a way I didn't expect to.</i>

188
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,201

196

<i>I'd spend three hours in a record store.</i>

200
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,410
I'd stand at those racks
and look at the covers.

201
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,408
<i>I'd be like, "Wow,</i>
<i>I really like the way that cover looks."</i>

202

204
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,384
[Paula] <i>I was a kid with the best job</i>
<i>in New York City.</i>

205
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,167
<i>I had recording artists</i>
<i>and their managers,</i>

206
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,383

207

<i>to get them to agree to some design</i>
<i>and get it to come to fruition.</i>

209
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,973
<i>And I just became very good at it.</i>

210
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,403
<i>Big recording artists were the things</i>
<i>the company cared about the most.</i>

211
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:44,198
So I would do pretty much what
the recording artists wanted me to do.

212
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,832
Like for example,
here on this Bruce Springsteen cover.

213
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,499
It was shot by a friend of his
who was a butcher,

214
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,959
and I put
this typewriter typography on it.

215
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,500
Cheap Trick<i> </i>was a little bit different.

216
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:58,464
They weren't as big as Bruce Springsteen,
so I had a bit more control.

217
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,177
With jazz artists,
they got to be a little artier.

218
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:06,428
Like, this is a series of covers I did
for Bob James's label,

My favorite was always this matchbook.

222

And then, of course,
the monster illustration,<i> Boston</i>.

Six million copies, I think,
in the first month of sales.

It was quite something.

225
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:30,373
<i>They wanted it to be something futuristic,</i>

226
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:35,003
<i>so we came up with this half-baked idea</i>
<i>that the Earth was blowing up</i>

227

But when I die, it will say,

However, if nobody cared about the album,
that's where I did typography.

241
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,719

because I was the artist,

242

<i>If you're not in a state of play,</i>

and some of the fives are just made up
of geometric shapes

271
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,934
that come from the park itself.

272
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,099
For example, the forms come from
the amphitheater

273
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,767
and then they create the 55s.

274
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:51,027
This notion actually came from the fact
that the park sits up on these pillars.

275
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,742
So these are the original sketches.

00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:51,677
<i>It's in the street,</i>
<i>it's on the shelf at the supermarket.</i>

479
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:57,517
Paula is the most influential
woman graphic designer on the planet.

480
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,074
[Paula] <i>I never thought about myself</i>
<i>as a feminist.</i>

481
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,068
<i>Yet, when I was working</i>
<i>at CBS Records in the '70s,</i>

482
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:10,076
<i>women in the design business</i>
<i>at that time were agents, they were reps.</i>

483
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,543
<i>You'd sit there and think, "Oh, my God,</i>
<i>what are they going to do with me?</i>

484
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,043
<i>What am I going to do with them?"</i>

485
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,875
<i>It's quite wild when you see it firsthand.</i>

486
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:24,302
All of a sudden, you turn around
and you go, "Oh, my God, that was sexism!"

487
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,633
You know, there it is.

488
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,097
And it's like any other -ism.

489
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,939
<i>If I'm sitting with a new client,</i>
<i>I can see in the first glance</i>

490
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,399
that he's wondering
why he's got this old lady.

491
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,993
I mean, I just thought,
"I'm a designer. Look at it."

492
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:51,121
Hi! Nice to meet you on the phone.

493
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,209
I got your materials
that I've been looking at.

494
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,245
What are you looking to do now?

495
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:04,088
<i>I have an overall plan</i>
<i>about how I'd approach work.</i>

496
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,222
<i>Some of it is strategic</i>
<i>and some of it is intuitive.</i>

497
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,640
Are you promoting the institution
or are you promoting the show?

498
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:15,478
<i>The strategic part</i>
<i>is absorbing information from the client.</i>

499
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,099
How many plays do you put on in a season?

500
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:23,151
And do you have other kinds of festivals,
or smaller programs,

501
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,153
or things like under the radar, or...?

502
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,823
<i>I want to understand</i>
<i>why they look the way they look.</i>

503
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,703
What's interesting is you seem,
from what I see here,

504
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,405
to be a little bit all over the map.

505
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,326
I think you should develop
a visual language.

506
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,746
That's what we did
with The Public and Atlantic.

507
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,795
You don't need
to see the logo to know what it is.

508
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,720
You should be as powerful,
visible, understandable,

509
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,101
recognizable as anything in town.

510
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,636
<i>You're not changing somebody.</i>

511
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:00,265
<i>You're making them a more perfect vision</i>
<i>of where they started.</i>

512
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,983
<i>So the job is to traverse</i>
<i>these different roads</i>

513
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,565
and try to get either an individual,
a group of people,

514
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,491
or a whole corporation to be able to see.

515
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,818
[applause]

516
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:20,921
[Paula] <i>In 1998, Citibank was merging</i>
<i>with Travelers Insurance Company.</i>

517
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,210
<i>They wanted a logo</i>
<i>that reflected the merger</i>

518
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,625
and they wanted to launch it
in the newspaper

519
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,264
three weeks after hiring us to do it.

520
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,222
<i>Travelers Insurance Company</i>
<i>had a red umbrella.</i>

521
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:37,183
<i>Citibank had type</i>
<i>that was in italic form.</i>

522
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,561
<i>It took only a moment of time</i>
<i>to design the logo.</i>

523
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,064
There's a T.

524
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,685
The bottom of a lowercase T
has a little hook on the bottom.

525
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:46,904
It's a straight line.

526
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:50,153
If you put an arc on the top,
that's an umbrella.

527
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,777
There are two Is in Citi.

528
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,623
It means the edge of the arc
can line up with the two Is.

529
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:58,245
<i>There were a million meetings</i>
<i>trying to get by 'em.</i>

530
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,248
<i>"What if you do it this way, or that way?</i>

531
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,540
<i>Show it to me on stationery,</i>
<i>show it to me on a card.</i>

532
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,924
<i>It's got to be red on top</i>
<i>and blue on the bottom.</i>

533
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,801
<i>What do you do with the blue wave?</i>
<i>Is it something you use in retail?</i>

534
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,799
<i>What if you put that</i>
<i>back on the credit card?"</i>

535
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,801
Those were all the things
that were being worked out

536
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,684
for nearly, I think, two years
before the thing launched.

537
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:21,976
<i>The design of the logo is never really</i>
<i>the hard part of the job.</i>

538
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,230
It's persuading
a million people to use it.

539
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,822
So this is a diagram of a meeting.

540
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,451
You are giving a presentation.

541
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:45,214
This line is the line of the reasonable
level of expectation that everyone has

542
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,212
when you walk into the room.

543
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:51,384
I got to say that, to my surprise,
I very much like the black and white.

544
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:53,589
[Paula] <i>You begin to present,</i>

545
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,351
and you come above
the reasonable level of expectation.

546
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:01,599
<i>Everybody gets enthusiastic,</i>
<i>people begin to start asking questions.</i>

547
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:07,733
...a whole extra outline, right?
The others only have three.

548
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,614
<i>And about right here,</i>

549
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,401
<i>you've reached the height</i>
<i>of the appreciation</i>

550
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,895
<i>that you're gonna get</i>
<i>for this presentation.</i>

551
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:19,077
You will be putting them
on top of images where they create labels.

552
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:22,199
So it's like a label
smacked over a photograph.

553
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:26,079
That's the... And we have...
The buses are behind you.

554
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,418
<i>And at this point,</i>

555
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,587
somebody's going to make
a rebuttal to your presentation.

556
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:39,642
The contrast between the two
is more fun for me here than it is here,

557
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,851
because it's just...
I feel the separation more.

558
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,692
This, I kind of don't notice the contrast.

559
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,734
[Paula] <i>You're going to sink a little bit</i>
<i>below that line of expectation.</i>

560
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:53,317
You grab it back
and you make some concessions.

561
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,531
You know,
I may have to pull this down a bit.

562
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,783
Maybe it just has to touch it.

563
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,115
The thing is that the horizontal read
is always better.

564
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:05,792
Yes, see these are great,
the horizontal pops. I love that.

565
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,634
[Paula] <i>And you get up to about here.</i>

566
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:12,708
And at this point, this is as high
as you're ever gonna get.

567
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,718
It's not as high as here, but it's good.

568
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,720
Will this actually play in this color?

569
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,012
-[Paula] What, you don't think--
-I mean, I love it.

570
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,807
But I'm worried
you're going to change it

571
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,230
when you actually do it.

572
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,558
No, I wanted that.

573
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:29,693
Just to say, that's the thing
I'm most concerned about.

574
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,651
I just think it needs to be larger.

575
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,530
The meeting must end here,

576
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,858
because what will happen
is a counter-rebuttal to your offer,

577
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:40,485
it will go down
below the reasonable level of expectation,

578
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,083
and then come back only nearly above it

579
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,579
and will continue on,
until you reach sudden death.

580
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:51,422
<i>They want proof that this is really,</i>
<i>really gonna work.</i>

581
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,753
<i>The problem is there isn't proof.</i>

582
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,666
<i>It's how do people see and perceive</i>
<i>and accept things.</i>

583
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,259
I feel like, as usual,
once I sit with them for a while,

584
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,974
they really start to shout
in a very specific way

585
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,516
and it just feels like, of course,
this is The Public.

586
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,690
Of course, it's grabbing the attention
that Shakespeare in the Park always does.

587
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,520
-I think they're awesome.
-Fantastic.

588
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,185
It's going to be a black summer.

589
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,284
[laughter]

590
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,896
-All right. Bye.
-Good to see you.

591
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,655
-Terrific. Good work. Thank you.
-Thanks.

592
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,238
-[Patrick] Perfect.
-Thank you.

[Paula] <i>I notice it more and more</i>
<i>as I get older.</i>

594
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:40,262
<i>How important</i>
<i>the act of making stuff is to me.</i>

595
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:49,636
<i>My father saw two of the paintings I did</i>
<i>before he died.</i>

596
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,812
<i>I was sort of embarrassed to show him,</i>

597

<i>because, of course,</i>
<i>it's totally inaccurate.</i>

598

And I brought him in
and showed him the map

599
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,645
and I said, "I guess you think I'm crazy,"

600
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,907
and he said,
"No, I never did anything that creative."
