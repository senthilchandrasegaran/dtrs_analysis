00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:15,217
[Ilse] <i>Some people think</i>
<i>interior design is a look.</i>

2
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,269
In fact, "It must be
really fun buying furniture"

3
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,602
is something one person
said to me once.

4
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,607
<i>But I see it differently.</i>

5
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:28,282
<i>We spend 87% of our lives</i>
<i>inside buildings.</i>

6
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:34,991
<i>How they are designed really affects</i>
<i>how we feel, how we behave.</i>

7
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,457
<i>Design is not just a visual thing.</i>

8
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,879
<i>It's a thought process.</i>

9
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,628
<i>It's a skill.</i>

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,760
<i>Ultimately, design is a tool</i>
<i>to enhance our humanity.</i>

11
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,726
<i>It's a frame for life.</i>

12
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,058
[lively piano music playing]

13
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,791
[gentle studio chatter]

14
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,995
[colleague] It's still got
a really strong design quality.

15
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,547
I just added a note.
That's a stone floor...

16
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,972
[Ilse] <i>All our projects start</i>
<i>with a strategy.</i>

17
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,933
<i>Basically prioritizing people,</i>

18
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,722
<i>putting the human experience</i>
<i>at the beginning of the design process.</i>

19
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,271
Each of these chairs has met many
of these criteria.

20
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,107
I think we should
narrow it down to two.

21
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,565
Michael, what are the pluses
and minuses of this chair?

22
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,567
[Michael] The materials are great.
We really like it.

23
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,410
-It's got real tactile memory, actually.
-Yeah, and it's quite easy to handle.

24
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:48,878
[Ilse] <i>In our process,</i>
<i>we interrogate the place, the client,</i>

25
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,756
<i>and then empathize...</i>

26
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,418
<i>because empathy is a cornerstone</i>
<i>of design.</i>

27
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,051
[Michael] It's great. The form.

28
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,507
[Ilse] Yeah, it's a good chair.

29
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,267
-Quite a challenge, isn't it?
-[colleague] Yeah.

30
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,690
[Ilse] You want to feel easy and relaxed,

31
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,649
so I think it does come down to these two.

32
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,028
<i>And then from that process</i>
<i>of interrogation and empathy,</i>

33
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,201
<i>that's when</i>
<i>the imaginative process kicks in.</i>

34
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,197
<i>Interiors, which for ages</i>
<i>have been treated</i>

35
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,492
<i>as being</i>
<i>a slightly sillier side to design,</i>

36
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,044
<i>is now beginning to be taken seriously.</i>

37
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,045
[TV reporter] <i>Glancing at</i>
<i>the artistic lines of this modern home,</i>

38
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:41,723
<i>we forget the old idea that houses should</i>
<i>follow past and out-of-date fashions.</i>

39
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,483
Traditionally, interior design has been
a predominantly visual medium,

40
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,902
it's been rather frothy and flamboyant.

41
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,611
<i>It's all about showmanship</i>
<i>and theatricality.</i>

42
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,120
Ilse's approach is much more subtle,
it's much more sensual.

43
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:10,924
It's about how things feel and smell
as much as how things look.

44
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:17,133
<i>She wants to imbue people</i>
<i>with a sense of wellbeing, empowerment</i>

45
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,295
and sort of gentle joyfulness.

46
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,975
By many people, Ilse's seen
as something of an icon... [chuckles]

47
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:39,398
<i>because she has developed</i>
<i>a whole new way of looking at interiors.</i>

48
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,410
One of the qualities
that distinguishes her work

49
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,453
from that of other interior designers

50
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,826
<i>is that it's about</i>
<i>how we experience a room</i>

51
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,214
<i>and how we ourselves feel in a room</i>

52
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,214
<i>to satisfy the subconscious.</i>

53
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,135
Ilse's strength is her humanity
and her caring.

54
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,099
She really cares about wellbeing.

55
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,600
<i>Everything that surrounds us</i>
<i>is really done with this care,</i>

56
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,273
<i>with this love that makes you</i>
<i>kind of feel good.</i>

57
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,360
And not just look good, too.

58
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,991
[Ilse] <i>I am a very self-motivated person.</i>

59
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,820
I actually had always worked.

60
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,537
I mean, literally, I started working
on the side when I was 13

61
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,289
<i>because I've never wanted</i>
<i>to ask for money.</i>

62
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,542
<i>I've always wanted to be independent.</i>

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,050
<i>I worked at Pitts Cottage as a waitress,</i>
<i>I'm sure completely illegally,</i>

64
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,760
serving coffees and shortbread biscuits
which had a cherry in the middle

65
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,433
and looked like a breast. [chuckles]

66
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,762
I remember it so clearly.

67
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:55,435
<i>From a kid, I was interested in how people</i>
<i>behave differently in different spaces.</i>

68
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,772
<i>That fascinated me.</i>

69
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:03,109
<i>So when I went to university, I studied</i>
<i>history and history of architecture.</i>

70
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,531
<i>After university, I was the studio manager</i>
<i>for an architect,</i>

71
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,497
<i>and from there, was hired</i>
<i>to work on the editorial team</i>

72
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,000
of an architect's magazine,
because I knew my stuff.

73
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:22,133
<i>So when I was asked to start </i>Elle Deco,
<i>it was a no-brainer</i>

74
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,585
because I really wanted
to do a contemporary magazine

75
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,604
that was warmer
and reached a bigger audience.

76
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,852
[Rawsthorn] <i>Ilse has always treated</i>
<i>interior design,</i>

77
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,685
<i>both as a designer</i>
<i>and magazine editor originally,</i>

78
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:42,442
with a seriousness and a complexity
that was arguably lacking before.

79
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,704
[Ilse] <i>Editing a magazine</i>
<i>is really about having</i>

80
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,661
<i>a very close connection to your audience</i>

81
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:54,372
<i>and knowing how to reach them,</i>
<i>how to excite them, how to inspire them.</i>

82
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,666
<i>It's a conversation, essentially,</i>
<i>that you have with your reader.</i>

83
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,205
<i>We presented these livable spaces.</i>

84
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:07,007
<i>The journey of the scene,</i>
<i>4,000, 5,000 different interiors,</i>

85
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,311
<i>seeing how people really use space.</i>

86
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,389
<i>Which spaces really worked,</i>
<i>which spaces really touched our audience.</i>

87
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,108
<i>I mean, that was really</i>
<i>my design education.</i>

88
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,363
But I wanted to do my own thing,
I wanted to make things,

89
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:28,163
I wanted to get my hands dirty
and really do something for myself.

90
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,167
<i>I'm driven by my curiosities.</i>

91
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:46,258
<i>By learning more about what made</i>
<i>people comfortable in space,</i>

92
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:51,221
<i>researching in Anthropology,</i>
<i>Behavioral Science and so on,</i>

93
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:56,308
<i>that really made me understand</i>
<i>how we discover the world.</i>

94
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,773
<i>I wrote a book called </i>Sensual Home.

95
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:08,069
<i>In that book, I went through the senses</i>
<i>because it seemed to me fascinating.</i>

96
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,704
<i>That is, after all,</i>
<i>how we experience the world.</i>

97
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,945
<i>We are our bodies.</i>

98
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,832
<i>Writing </i>Sensual Home
<i>was the aha moment,</i>

99
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,213
<i>because it wasn't</i>
<i>the current understanding of design.</i>

100
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:31,387
<i>So I knew that my days</i>
<i>as a two-dimensional person were over</i>

101
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,259
<i>and I really wanted to move into three</i>

102
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,466
<i>and figure out</i>
<i>whether I could work in that field.</i>

103
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,557
[piano music playing]

104
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,355
My first project was
immediately after I left <i>Elle Decoration,</i>

105
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:49,572
when Nick Jones from Soho House
asked me to help him with Babington House.

106
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,621
<i>His first hotel out in the countryside.</i>

107
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,790
<i>I had no practical experience</i>
<i>at that point,</i>

108
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,671
so it was pretty adventurous of him
to ask me.

109
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,166
<i>Nick started on a path</i>
<i>of it being rather traditional.</i>

110
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,797
<i>It's in the country, so it was going to be</i>
<i>a country house hotel.</i>

111
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,929
I was very clear that
that was the last thing it should be.

112
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,965
<i>It was for the media and advertising</i>
<i>and film crowd,</i>

113
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:21,227
<i>so my proposal said it should be</i>
<i>this very informal place</i>

114
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,981
<i>that you could just treat</i>
<i>as if it was your own.</i>

115
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,897
<i>Like a family house of a friend</i>

116
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,613
where the parents have gone away
for the weekend

117
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,033
and left the keys to the drinks cabinet.

118
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,865
<i>And now, that doesn't seem so radical,</i>

119
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,738
<i>but really then,</i>
<i>it was the first of a kind.</i>

120
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,584
<i>And then Nick asked me to do</i>
<i>the next Soho House in New York.</i>

121
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,749
<i>And that's really where the studio began</i>

122
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,756
<i>because that's when</i>
<i>I brought people in to help me,</i>

123
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,718
<i>and it grew from there.</i>

124
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,638
<i>And it has been</i>
<i>one project after another since then.</i>

125
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,652
<i>Cecconi's was an old,</i>
<i>failing Italian restaurant</i>

126
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,229
<i>in the center of London.</i>

127
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,980
<i>We looked at making it</i>

128
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:12,606
<i>something that had the character</i>
<i>of the grand Italian station bar.</i>

129
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,029
<i>Those wonderful, democratic,</i>
<i>beautiful spaces,</i>

130
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:20,246
<i>that was very much like a stage</i>
<i>for the staff that work there.</i>

131
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:25,827
<i>And an interior made with materials all</i>
<i>from the region around Venice.</i>

132
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:32,796
<i>High Road House, Chiswick, was about</i>
<i>making this great public space downstairs,</i>

133
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,175
<i>and then rooms</i>
<i>that reflected the simplicity</i>

134
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,722
<i>of the arts and crafts houses</i>
<i>that were all around it.</i>

135
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,310
<i>We did The Olde Bell,</i>

136
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,062
<i>a really quite smelly pub</i>
<i>when we first saw it.</i>

137
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,693
<i>We were asked to define</i>
<i>what an English coaching inn would be,</i>

138
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,863
<i>translating that into furniture,</i>

139
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,566
<i>materials,</i>

140
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,493
<i>food,</i>

141
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,486
<i>uniforms.</i>

142
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,618
<i>We also worked with Mathias Dahlgren</i>
<i>in Stockholm</i>

143
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,665
<i>to develop two restaurants</i>

144
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,498
<i>which would be</i>
<i>the physical manifestation</i>

145
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,745
<i>of his love and philosophy</i>
<i>of Swedish gastronomy.</i>

146
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,307
<i>We did the first Aesop in the UK.</i>

147
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,521
<i>The owner said the thing about skin care</i>
<i>that made the difference</i>

148
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,191
<i>was not just what was in the product,</i>

149
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,360
<i>but the ritual of daily maintenance.</i>

150
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,979
<i>So we put the sink</i>
<i>in the middle of the store.</i>

151
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:37,662
<i>The notion of taking care of yourself</i>
<i>elevated through design.</i>

152
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:47,174
<i>What we're really interested in</i>
<i>is translating the client,</i>

153
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,785
<i>the future life of a building,</i>

154
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,747
<i>into a design language.</i>

155
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,554
<i>So quite a range.</i>

156
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,885
<i>What was really exciting was to figure out</i>
<i>if our approach worked</i>

157
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,812
<i>for very different people</i>
<i>in very different places.</i>

158
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,234
<i>We managed to create</i>
<i>these special identities.</i>

159
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,944
<i>I mean, people said that,</i>
<i>while they didn't look the same,</i>

160
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,396
<i>they did have a similar feeling.</i>

161
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:22,281
<i>By creating places that really affect</i>
<i>people through five senses,</i>

162
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:26,117
<i>they had a real connection</i>
<i>that was very unusual at the time.</i>

163
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:42,048
<i>While I know what works for me visually,</i>

164
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:47,386
I need to make sense of it
through writing

165
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,768
in order to then do what I do.

166
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,404
I need both hands to speak to each other.

167
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,485
<i>So the second book</i>
<i>was trying to figure out</i>

168
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:05,240
<i>how to structure my design thoughts</i>
<i>into actually a design manifesto.</i>

169

[Thompson]
<i>Ilse makes things easy to comprehend</i>

170
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,504
<i>'cause she's broken them down</i>
<i>into very basic ideas.</i>

171
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,263
Twenty-plus years ago,
Ilse had very new ideas,

172
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:22,008
and I think it takes a long time for a new
idea to really become an established idea,

173
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,263
and so it's been a process.

174
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,808
[Ilse] <i>I grew up</i>
<i>in a pretty progressive family.</i>

175
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,522
<i>Both my parents were</i>
<i>extremely free thinking.</i>

176
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,901
<i>My mother was a trained artist</i>

177
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,160
<i>and my father was an investigative</i>
<i>journalist for </i>The Sunday Times

178
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,238
<i>and an economist.</i>

179
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:48,913
My father was very demanding academically.
I learnt how to prove myself very young.

180
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:54,706
<i>Because he was of the mind that humans</i>
<i>don't question or interrogate reality</i>

181
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,922
<i>before they have an opinion.</i>

182
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,089
If you interrogate a situation,

183
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,261
actually, the answers
present themselves to you.

184
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,342
<i>And my mother was adventurous.</i>

185
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,847
<i>She gave us total freedom really,</i>
<i>with our own environment</i>

186
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,601
<i>to express ourselves.</i>

187
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,395
But when I was a teenager,
my mother got quite sick.

188
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,401
<i>She was in her mid-30s.</i>

189
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:23,201
<i>I spent quite a lot of time going in</i>
<i>and out of hospitals to hang out with her.</i>

190
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,945
<i>Those great long corridors</i>
<i>reduced people to patients,</i>

191
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,164
<i>waiting for the doctor in the white coat</i>
<i>to march up and down.</i>

192
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,868
<i>They were really inhuman.</i>

193
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:40,171
<i>To see that a building could have</i>
<i>such an impact on the way people felt,</i>

194
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,804
<i>on the way they interacted.</i>

195
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:48,302
It was a real revelation
that human values are non-negotiable.

196
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:56,731
<i>That combination</i>
<i>of interrogation and empathy</i>

197
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,573
<i>is something that's been with me</i>
<i>from the very beginning.</i>

198
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:12,833
<i>When we first approach a project,</i>
<i>we always hold off what our opinion is.</i>

199
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,372
<i>So we ask questions. We watch a lot.</i>

200
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,382
<i>We listen.</i>

201
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:23,009
I always say to my team we've got
two eyes, two ears and one mouth

202
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,379
and we should use them
in that proportion.

203
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,546
[general project chatter]

204
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:34,347
[Ilse] <i>Through that process</i>
<i>of interrogation and empathy,</i>

205
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,021

00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,645
<i>Our expertise in terms of process</i>

207
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,743

<i>working on a project like with IKEA.</i>

208
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,490
<i>They noticed the humanity of our approach,</i>

209
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:54,575
<i>and that's something that is embedded</i>
<i>in their ideology as a company.</i>

210
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:01,292
They're very interested
in how we can bring those human values

211
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,957
into their restaurants.

212
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,591
This has to be a very robust vision

213
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,684
because it's going to be
translated round the world.

214
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,180
[colleague] It's a huge thing.

215
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,812
The restaurant is always done
as an afterthought.

216
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,730
The store is the mammoth thing
to get right.

217
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,638
Yeah.

218
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,096
And, like we talk about,
the end of the system,

219
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,647
that's the bit that gets
the last bits of the money

220
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,111
and the last bits of the time.

221
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:26,531
So it would be quite interesting
to reverse that process.

222
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:31,658
I didn't know it was called a restaurant.
I just thought that's really interesting.

223
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,121
-[Ilse] It's a cafeteria.
-[colleague] Yeah.

224
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:39,544
They can use that space to encourage
and give sort of behavioral cues to people

225
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,004
to eat more healthily, especially kids.

226
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:47,552
Although it sounds like the hot dog
is something that will be hung on to.

227
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,972
Maybe that's okay.

228
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,930
It just needs to be sort of framed
in a different language, not advertised...

229
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,484
[Ilse] But apparently the veggie ball
is doing brilliantly.

230
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,098
[colleague] Is it really? That's great.

231
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,015
[colleague] The next steps
will be to go and do

232
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,944
some very rigorous observation in IKEA

233
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,484
in the existing environments.

234
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,660
[Ilse] <i>Changes on this scale</i>
<i>could make a massive impact.</i>

235
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,720
<i>Almost every client finds this room</i>
<i>their favorite space.</i>

236
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:36,013
<i>Each project has its specific</i>
<i>material language that we might use</i>

237
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:40,137
<i>in terms of how they're laid,</i>
<i>how they're finished.</i>

238
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,436
<i>Materials are the thing</i>
<i>that tell the truth.</i>

239
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,521
<i>It's something that</i>
<i>we go into in great detail.</i>

240
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,359
<i>Humans naturally are drawn to materials.</i>

241
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,123
<i>We discover the world through our senses.</i>

242
00:17:56,534 --> 00:18:00,004
<i>What we're interested in</i>
<i>is how materials speak to us.</i>

243
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,380
<i>The things that touch the skin,</i>
<i>the things that really give you memory.</i>

244
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,419
<i>We focus a lot on that.</i>

245
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,434
<i>Materials are</i>
<i>much more compelling and convincing</i>

246
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,718
<i>once you see them in context,</i>

247
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,511
or at least in the character of light
that will hit it,

248
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:21,477
and ideally in association with
the other materials that will be with it.

249
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:35,616
<i>Really, it's that combination of materials</i>
<i>that speak to each other</i>

250
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:42,118
<i>and create this tactile, warm</i>
<i>and very physical environment.</i>

251
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:48,709
<i>So for example, when we were working</i>
<i>on Cathay Pacific Airport lounges,</i>

252
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:54,094
<i>you really need to choose materials</i>
<i>that are functional, but yet luxurious.</i>

253
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,218
<i>Now, these are people who are tired,</i>
<i>who are probably jet-lagged,</i>

254
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,514
<i>and a lounge is a place</i>
<i>to make them feel human.</i>

255
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:07,023
<i>Typically, an airport lounge will often</i>
<i>line chairs up rather institutionally,</i>

256
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,524
<i>and we didn't want to do that.</i>

257
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:12,856
<i>We wanted it to have the sense of</i>
<i>domestic space, but yet function well.</i>

258
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,736
<i>That was a challenge.</i>

259
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,989
<i>The lounge needed to have</i>
<i>minimal maintenance,</i>

260
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,704
<i>to be somewhere that could withstand</i>
<i>many, many people per day</i>

261
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:25,003
<i>going through with wheelie suitcases</i>
<i>which bash the walls.</i>

262
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,081
<i>So paint, for example, was a no go.</i>

263
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,801
It needed to be materialized
in a way that expressed Cathay

264
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,050
and not, for example, another airline.

265
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,262
So when it came to choosing materials
for the first-class lounge,

266
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,144
in the hallway, we chose onyx.

267
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:46,019
<i>It's a natural material,</i>
<i>it's from the area, it's an Asian material</i>

268
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,056
<i>and because it's robust.</i>

269
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,654
<i>It's not the cheapest material</i>
<i>you could find,</i>

270
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,492
so we needed to balance it with something
more down-to-earth that offset it.

271
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,239
So we chose a limestone.

272
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,870
<i>But then we needed to add warmth.</i>

273
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,623
We actually understand materials best
by contrast.

274
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:09,955
Our senses are wired in such a way

275
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:14,052
<i>that we understand that rough</i>
<i>feels rougher by contrast with smooth.</i>

276
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,513
To get the best out of these materials,
we needed to find its opposite.

277
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:24,560
So mohair velvet,
which is a very robust velvet,

278
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,770
which is totally durable
but feels luxurious.

279
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,478
<i>So offsetting the hardness,</i>

280
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,364
<i>the coolness of the onyx</i>
<i>and the limestone.</i>

281
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:39,105
Then bringing in something natural,
both in finish and also form.

282
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:44,582
And then to bring in the touch of lux,
it had a brass base.

283
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,792
<i>So it was less about the aesthetics</i>
<i>or the appearance,</i>

284
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,133
<i>although that's obviously in the mix,</i>

285
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,748
<i>but much more about</i>
<i>how to make an environment</i>

286
00:20:54,837 --> 00:21:00,047
<i>that made people feel better after</i>
<i>they'd been there than when they arrived.</i>

<i>It's all about wellbeing.</i>

288
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,891
<i>That means that</i>
<i>when people walk into it,</i>

289
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,934
they don't know why they feel
the way they feel,

290
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,399
but it's actually all been orchestrated.

[Ilse] <i>The execution of our projects</i>
<i>comes down to the tools.</i>

<i>Tangible tools,</i>

<i>CAD, Vectorworks, etc.</i>

<i>three inches is a massive difference</i>
<i>as to whether something is comfortable</i>

301

<i>or whether it's the right dimension</i>
<i>to have a conversation.</i>

<i>What's interesting about tables</i>

00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,005
But when we were designing
some interiors,

319
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,800
we needed to do
specific products for those interiors,

320
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,425
because we couldn't find them.

321
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,772
<i>The Brass Cabinet was an original piece</i>
<i>that we did for the Aesop store.</i>

322
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,806
<i>And we evolved the design</i>
<i>for other clients.</i>

323
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,820
<i>To make a good product</i>
<i>is so much more complicated</i>

324
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,201
<i>than just throwing a sketch over a wall</i>

325
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,989
<i>or a CAD drawing to a manufacturer.</i>

326
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,487
<i>Design is a relationship with the maker.</i>

327
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:39,169
<i>The best results are always</i>
<i>about the collaboration.</i>

328
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:44,466
<i>You really need to sample it</i>
<i>and refine a product.</i>

329
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:50,718
<i>It takes many iterations,</i>
<i>so that ultimately it can live on its own.</i>

330
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,979
<i>So for example, when we were designing</i>
<i>the Sinnerlig range for IKEA,</i>

331
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,483
<i>it was very important to us</i>

332
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,984
<i>that we make furniture</i>
<i>that could reach the whole world.</i>

333
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,318
The project for IKEA,

334
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,865
trying to understand
what is mass manufacturing

335
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:14,119
and instead of maybe saying,
"Oh, this is horrible."

336
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,083
It's questioning
and trying to understand

337
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,503
that mass manufacturing
can give us a great benefit,

338
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:23,713
because it can give us access
to things for everyone.

339
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:29,264
[Ilse] <i>For many people, IKEA is a big,</i>
<i>bad cheap furniture warehouse.</i>

340
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,512
<i>But actually, what's really interesting</i>

341
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:38,436
<i>is strategically what is in that system</i>
<i>that can be used positively,</i>

342
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:41,396
<i>using design to make things better.</i>

343
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,360
<i>The basis of our relationship was to bring</i>
<i>emotional values into that system</i>

344
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:53,486
<i>and come out with products</i>
<i>that are sustainable,</i>

345
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,406
<i>but people really love.</i>

346
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,619
What we wanted to do
was not just product development.

347
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:02,497
We wanted a development of an experience,

348
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:07,344
<i>and since StudioIlse is working with</i>
<i>both products and interior design,</i>

349
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,843
<i>that's like a perfect fit.</i>

350
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:14,138
This is actually one year
from when they started, still here.

351
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,261
It's kind of nice.

352
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,684
[Ilse] It's great to see it in the store.

353
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:25,022
<i>Looking at materials that we could</i>
<i>work with, we came to love cork.</i>

354
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:31,696
<i>Because it's very abundant,</i>
<i>utterly sustainable, there's no waste.</i>

355
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:36,913
<i>It goes from being the bark,</i>
<i>harvested in the very old way</i>

356
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:40,914
<i>with skilled craftsmen who know</i>
<i>how to do it without damaging the trees.</i>

357
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,883
<i>In order to get that tactility,</i>

358
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,919
<i>we had to work very hard</i>
<i>to find a new coating.</i>

359
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,922
<i>Design thrives on restrictions, actually.</i>

360
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:54,848
<i>I think of it as a primal drive,</i>
<i>that you need those tight restrictions</i>

361
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,968
<i>and then, somehow or other,</i>
<i>you come out of it.</i>

362
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:03,095
<i>We looked at the process</i>
<i>of making ceramics in Vietnam</i>

363
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:07,567
<i>and saw that a way of creating</i>
<i>imperfection and difference</i>

364
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,069
<i>was staring us straight in the face,</i>

365
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,151
<i>which is that the jars are dip dyed.</i>

366
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,410
<i>What you got was</i>
<i>there's never one the same.</i>

367
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,869
<i>The process was nearly three years.</i>

368
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:22,208
People don't realize, I think,
how long it really takes to make something

369
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,959
that comes out at this price
in these quantities.

370
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:30,384
Bringing together good design
on this scale is just, for us,

371
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,514
a really, really interesting end result.

372
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,848
Now, we're taking the next step,
into the restaurant,

373
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,099
bringing those learnings
into what we could do

374
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,641
to the restaurant business of IKEA...

375
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:41,604
[Ilse] Yeah.

376
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,103
[Engman] and that's going to be fun.

377
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:08,749
[Ilse] <i>I grew up in a part of London</i>
<i>that was filled with derelict houses,</i>

378
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,261
<i>which were being smashed down,</i>
<i>but had beautiful 19th-century tiles.</i>

379
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:17,221
<i>There was no understanding</i>
<i>of the beauty of these things.</i>

380
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:21,142
<i>My mother and I used to go out at night</i>
<i>with hammer and chisel and rescue them,</i>

381
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:24,603
<i>so they wouldn't be smashed</i>
<i>by the wrecking ball the next day.</i>

382
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:31,112
<i>I've always, since a child,</i>
<i>been fascinated by the atmosphere.</i>

383
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:36,032
<i>And I still am. I think that houses</i>
<i>carry the atmosphere of their past.</i>

384
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:41,949
<i>Being a designer,</i>
<i>in some way, gives you X-ray eyes</i>

385
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,455
<i>and you're able to see through</i>
<i>the current iteration of a building</i>

386
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,579
<i>and how you can build on that.</i>

387
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,732
<i>Working on </i>Ett Hem<i> was</i>
<i>a four-and-a-half year conversation</i>

388
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:09,558
<i>because it had quite a tricky time going</i>
<i>through planning and historic permission.</i>

389
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,189
Before collaborating with Ilse,
I had googled her

390
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:19,196
and understood, you know,
"Wow, she's a rock star." [chuckles]

391
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,485
<i>We spent eight months together.</i>

392
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,536
<i>They really took the time</i>
<i>to get to know me,</i>

393
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,830
<i>showing them, you know, houses</i>
<i>and places I liked here in Scandinavia,</i>

394
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,626
<i>pointing out the important things in life.</i>

395
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,922
<i>Values, food...</i>

396
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,548
<i>the rituals that I care for.</i>

397
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:43,005
[Ilse] Ett Hem<i> is in a building</i>
<i>built in 1913,</i>

398
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:46,676
<i>which was a really important time</i>
<i>in Swedish architectural history,</i>

399
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:50,727
<i>because the home became the focus</i>
<i>for arts and life.</i>

400
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,738
<i>The everyday was something</i>
<i>that was celebrated and delightful.</i>

401
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:07,122
<i>So one of the core principles</i>
<i>was moving away from opulent luxury</i>

402
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:10,964
<i>to a notion that luxury is attention.</i>
<i>It's care.</i>

403
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,835
<i>It's actually making the ordinary</i>
<i>extraordinary.</i>

404
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,507
[Mix] <i>Collaborating with Ilse,</i>

405
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,390
first of all, it's complete trust,
you really feel that.

406
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,060
<i>They are very thorough.</i>

407
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:35,438
[Ilse] <i>Typically, a building process</i>
<i>is a sequence of decisions,</i>

408
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,105
and what are called the "soft decisions"
are made at the end.

409
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,704
If indeed there is any money
left at the end, or time.

410
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,831
But in this case, we wanted
to reverse that process.

411
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:50,286
<i>We wanted to integrate the experience</i>
<i>of the place with the design</i>

412
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,792
<i>from the very beginning.</i>

413
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,552
<i>To make a place where,</i>
<i>the minute you walked in,</i>

414
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,628
<i>you just felt relaxed</i>
<i>and as though you belonged.</i>

415
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,006
<i>A home.</i>

416
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,722
Ett Hem:<i> a home.</i>

417
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:10,984
[Mix] <i>When we came up with</i>
<i>the name </i>Ett Hem, <i>it all fell into place.</i>

418
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,730
<i>So regarding the design,</i>

419
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,399
<i>every decision came back to</i>
<i>how does it feel</i>

420
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,652
<i>and how is it run in a normal home?</i>

421
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,620
[Ilse] <i>So we got rid of front</i>
<i>and back of house.</i>

422
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,036
<i>That formality, those boundaries.</i>

423
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:35,496
<i>Not only do they take up space,</i>
<i>they also make people behave differently.</i>

424
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,759
<i>It's more about the things you do,</i>
<i>rather than the way things look,</i>

425
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,926
<i>and how to create</i>
<i>a proper focus for those.</i>

426
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:48,179
<i>Those are the moments</i>
<i>that make it all worthwhile.</i>

427
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,098
In Denmark, they call that <i>hygge.</i>

428
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,311
<i>To focus on the moment,</i>

429
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:58,444
<i>on making the ordinary extraordinary,</i>
<i>making the normal special.</i>

430
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,609
<i>But what happens when we do that</i>

431
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,283
<i>is it makes us</i>
<i>much more open to each other</i>

432
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,987
<i>and much closer.</i>

433
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,620
<i>And it's a really interesting way</i>
<i>of building community.</i>

434
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,754
<i>For example, in the kitchen,</i>

435
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,961
<i>we made it warm and inviting</i>
<i>with a great old table</i>

436
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:22,263
<i>and we chose the things on the table,</i>
<i>so they really felt memorable, tactile.</i>

437
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,299
<i>Caring about the details,</i>

438
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,048
<i>thinking about how people</i>
<i>will experience the place.</i>

439
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,765
<i>People understand</i>
<i>the care that's gone into that.</i>

440
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,900
<i>Obviously, </i>Ett Hem<i> is a high-end,</i>
<i>relatively small hotel,</i>

441
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,153
<i>but you can do this on a bigger scale.</i>

442
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:57,084
<i>When you integrate design</i>
<i>into a company like IKEA,</i>

443
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,825
<i>it can have huge effect.</i>

444
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:08,297
What is so interesting about this project
is IKEA is very much a family store.

445
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,505
You really see big families here,

446
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,385
and it's quite tricky
to take a big family out to eat,

447
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:18,563
not to mention quite expensive,
so that's a really valuable contribution.

448
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,612
<i>The restaurant hasn't</i>
<i>kept step with the times.</i>

449
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,689
<i>And so they want us to interrogate that.</i>

450
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,820
This is the very area
which we're going to take

451
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,826
-and change it all, hopefully.
-Yeah.

452
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,745
[Engman] <i>We're in one of</i>
<i>the oldest stores now, of IKEA,</i>

453
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,040
<i>and it's the biggest store.</i>

454
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:45,417
<i>Now we're spread to 375 different stores</i>
<i>in 48 countries around the world.</i>

455
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,434
<i>It was really a new take</i>
<i>on how to serve food</i>

456
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,640
<i>and really good food.</i>

457
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:57,731
But this is the thing. It doesn't matter
how good we do our baked salmon.

458
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,436
If you meet it in the wrong way,
you get the wrong impression.

459
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,778
[Ilse] Yep, it feels like airport security
at the moment, you really...

460
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,899
-Let's say there is room for improvement.
-Yeah.

461
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,237
[Engman laughs]

462
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:16,119
[Engman] <i>We serve</i>
<i>640 million people every year.</i>

463
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:20,713
And this one alone
is something like 3,500, 4,000 a day.

464
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,670
-Yes. Huge.
-They're big numbers, yeah.

465
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,424
[Engman] <i>What we want to do with food</i>

466
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,224
<i>is make people live a healthier</i>
<i>and more sustainable lifestyle</i>

467
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:29,718
<i>through their food choices.</i>

468
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,637
[Ilse] It makes huge sense,

469
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,140
because if you can change the way
that children feel about food,

470
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,774
that really changes their futures.

471
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,100
[Engman] <i>Yeah, absolutely.</i>

472
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:44,774
[Ilse] <i>And I think design</i>
<i>really needs to address that.</i>

473
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,235
If you think about
the scale of the project...

474
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,830
I mean, 640 million customers a year
is beyond comprehension in a way.

475
00:33:56,826 --> 00:34:00,326
<i>It's a ten-year plan</i>
<i>and it's only the beginning.</i>

476
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,521
[Peña]<i> They say</i>
<i>that behind every great man</i>

477
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,937
<i>there's always a great woman.</i>

478
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,071
Here, it's the opposite.

479
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:35,525
Behind a great woman
maybe there's also a very good man.

480
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,540
[Ilse] <i>I was living in New York.</i>
<i>He was living in Milan.</i>

481
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,750
He was working
for the Design Academy Eindhoven,

482
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,041
which I had never heard of.

483
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,627
[Peña] <i>When we were having</i>
<i>a head of department meeting,</i>

484
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,462
<i>I was asked if I knew someone</i>
<i>that they could recommend</i>

485
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:55,138
<i>for a new design department that was</i>
<i>going to be created called Wellbeing.</i>

486
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,048
<i>I said, "Oh, maybe there's this lady,</i>
<i>Ilse Crawford."</i>

487
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,387
I only knew about her name and her work
from the magazine, <i>Elle Decoration</i>.

488
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,651
<i>She wrote a book, </i>Sensual Home,
<i>and for some reason, I never bought it.</i>

489
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,560
[laughs]

490
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:11,567
But actually, I married the one
that wrote it, so I didn't have to buy it.

491
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:17,866
[Ilse] <i>Oscar has been in</i>
<i>industrial product design for decades</i>

492
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,409
<i>and has joined the business.</i>

493
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:25,079
<i>He's Colombian, so he's brought in</i>
<i>this wonderful character and big heart.</i>

494
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,253
[Peña] This one is the last green touch.

495
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,842
That counts as a vegetable for you,
doesn't it?

496
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,675
I remember, wasn't it
in the 14th century in Turkey the--

497
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,011
Mmm...

498
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,755
It was grounds for a divorce

499
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,887
if a woman's husband
didn't make her coffee.

500
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,731
[Peña] <i>Yeah, I usually get up</i>
<i>and make you coffee.</i>

501
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,770
[Ilse laughs] <i>Exactly.</i>

502
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,818
<i>I think the small moments are</i>
<i>the things you remember in life.</i>

503
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,360
I mean, all of us remember
those connections.

504
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,613
In the design academy,
we are both heads of departments.

505
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,817
<i>I am Department of Man and Activity,</i>

506
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:04,868
<i>which is more about kind of products,</i>
<i>services, experiences.</i>

507
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,624
Ilse is Department of Wellbeing.

508
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:10,416
<i>This kind of human engineering</i>
<i>of the emotional side of things.</i>

509
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,172
[bicycle bell rings]

510
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,465
[Ilse] <i>I really do want wellbeing</i>

511
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,063
<i>in the sense of physical</i>
<i>and emotional health</i>

512
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,389
<i>to affect as many people as possible,</i>

513
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,151
<i>which is why I write the books,</i>
<i>why I teach.</i>

514
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,185
<i>I hope that it's contagious.</i>

515
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:39,695
<i>The whole structure of the school</i>

516
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:43,621
<i>is based on using people</i>
<i>who are working professionals.</i>

517
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:49,328
<i>So that's allowed me to combine my love</i>
<i>of working with the next generation</i>

518
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,956
<i>with running my own studio.</i>

519
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,853
When you first approached
the brush makers,

520
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,521
their immediate answer was no--

521
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,309
[student] Yeah, correct.
At the beginning, I think he just thought,

522
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,904
"Okay, he will be gone this afternoon,
and then he will not come back,"

523
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,611
but I came back the second time.

524
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:17,401
He was very surprised.
That's when I gained his trust.

525
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,529
So the old stick
is the one he made 23 years ago

526
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,124
and I put my new broom on it.

527
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,699
I think that's the conclusion
of our relationship,

528
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,405
how the new one and the old
came together in a broom.

529
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,536
-Relationships can be a bit messy.
-Yeah.

530
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,383
You have to sort of manage through that.

531
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,840
<i>It's really about having</i>
<i>these lively dialogues</i>

532
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,172
<i>with young individuals,</i>

533
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:43,637
<i>and then giving them the tool kits</i>
<i>to be able to develop their own voice.</i>

534
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,217
The aim is
to enhance the food preparation.

535
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,807
It acts like a magnifying lens,

536
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:53,813
so you get a different connection
with the food you are preparing.

537
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:57,147
[Ilse] What I really love about
your project is, when you look at them,

538
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,033
on the one hand, you see kitchen utensils,

539
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,490
and on the other hand,
you look at this material

540
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:02,861
you've never seen used that way.

541
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,157
[student] Exactly.

542
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,123
It's been a really,
really great trimester.

543
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,713
What I think was probably
quite challenging with the project

544
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:16,960
was the collaboration and how that
really involves a craft of a relationship.

545
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:22,965
It's actually a really good microcosm
of what will happen later on in life.

546
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,851
Whether you're working
on a small scale or big scale,

547
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,351
to be a designer focused on wellbeing,

548
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,733
you have to start
with how things are made.

549
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:37,146
You should feel very proud of yourselves
for the work you've put in this trimester,

550
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:38,442
so thank you.

551
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,703
[piano music playing]

552
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:52,713
<i>Being in the school is really being part</i>
<i>of that magical process of creation.</i>

553
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,749
<i>Seeing how things go</i>
<i>from nothing to something.</i>

554
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,047
[piano continues playing]

555
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:08,012
[Ilse] <i>And actually, now what's happening</i>
<i>in Eindhoven...</i>

556
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,060
<i>A lot of people are now coming</i>
<i>from other cities to go and live there</i>

557
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,811
<i>because you've got</i>
<i>the opportunity to have workshops,</i>

558
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:18,444
<i>you've got all these different skill sets</i>
<i>coming together,</i>

559
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,773
<i>a sort of mini Berlin.</i>

560
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,324
<i>I think design's got a great future.</i>

561
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,204
[piano continues playing]

562
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:37,037
<i>Wellbeing is now a philosophy</i>
<i>that's permeating a lot of design.</i>

563
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,338
<i>My fundamental hope, really,</i>

564
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:48,684
<i>is that everybody starts to think</i>
<i>in terms of putting people first,</i>

565
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:53,641
<i>and that's really something that</i>
<i>can be done on an individual basis.</i>

566
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,852
[piano continues playing]

567
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,356
<i>I mean, it's a pretty simple mission...</i>

568
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,188
<i>and we do it one space at a time.</i>

569
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:04,896
<i>One piece of design at a time.</i>

570
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:12,195
<i>When you prioritize the human needs</i>
<i>within a space,</i>

571
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,825
<i>design can have a profound impact.</i>

572
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,667
[piano continues playing]

573
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,132
<i>I hope that we can add</i>
<i>to the sum of human happiness.</i>

574
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,636
<i>To leave the world a better place.</i>
