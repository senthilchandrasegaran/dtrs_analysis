1
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:10,045
[director] Is this going to be
a slapstick comedy? Is it an action film?

2
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,925
You know, let's have fun with it.

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,892
-Yeah.
-We can do anything.

4
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:14,892
Oh yeah, nice.

5
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:19,103
So what do you think your movie should be?

6
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:24,226
All right, it should be like
the documentary version of <i>Inception</i>.

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,243
[Bjarke] <i>The whole premise</i>
<i>of </i>Inception<i> is that, in real life,</i>

8
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:35,203
<i>you can't really realize the dreams</i>
<i>because you have so many constraints,</i>

9
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:39,455
<i>but whereas in the dream world,</i>
<i>they could do all these kinds of things.</i>

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,130
And when architecture is at its best,
that's exactly what you're doing,

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,670
you're coming up with
something that is pure fiction.

12
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,674
Then after all the hard work,
all the permits,

13
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,466
all the budgeting
and all the construction,

14
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,509
it now becomes concrete reality.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,980
[Martinussen] <i>When Bjarke came around,</i>

16
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,096
<i>Danish architecture was somehow sleeping.</i>

17
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:09,355
<i>We had our heydays back</i>
<i>in the '50s, the '60s, the '70s.</i>

18
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,528
<i>We became world-famous compared to</i>
<i>how small we are, actually.</i>

19
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,621
<i>At the time Bjarke came around,</i>

20
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,537
<i>people didn't expect</i>
<i>anything really to happen.</i>

21
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:31,093
<i>And I think you could argue</i>
<i>that he really made everybody wake up.</i>

22
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,974
[dramatic music playing]

23
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:41,939
<i>What he was proposing had such a scale</i>
<i>and such revolutionary qualities</i>

24
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,229
<i>that the Danes got scared.</i>

25
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,670
[news reporter 1]<i> Bjarke Ingels</i>
<i>is having his moment.</i>

26
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,420
[news reporter 2] <i>At just 40 years old,</i>
<i>he has established himself</i>

27
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:11,092
<i>as one of the world's most inventive</i>
<i>and sought-after architects.</i>

28
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,303
[news reporter 3]
<i>His designs can be provocative.</i>

29
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,601
[commentator] <i>He's transforming</i>
<i>the shape of New York as we know it.</i>

30
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,509
[dramatic music continues]

31
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,707
[Bjarke] <i>There's no doubt that</i>
<i>in architecture there's this catch-22.</i>

32
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,126
<i>Nobody will entrust you</i>
<i>to build a building</i>

33
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,545
<i>until you've already built a building.</i>

34
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,599
<i>This is the Maritime Youth House</i>
<i>in Copenhagen.</i>

35
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,772
<i>It's...</i>

36
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,059
I guess it's our first building.

37
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:13,364
I celebrated my 30th birthday
in that space.

38
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,703
It was just completed.

39
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:20,075
<i>Our practice, Bjarke Ingels Group,</i>
<i>or in short BIG,</i>

40
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,368
<i>started 15 or 16 years ago.</i>

41
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:29,632
<i>Our rise has sort of coincided with</i>
<i>the rise of the environmental movement.</i>

42
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,917
<i>So we came up with this idea</i>
<i>of Hedonistic Sustainability.</i>

43
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:39,466
<i>What if sustainability could be part of</i>
<i>actually increasing your quality of life?</i>

44
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,228
<i>So I think in this case, it's a</i>
<i>beautiful site, but the site was polluted,</i>

45
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,518
<i>because they had been painting</i>
<i>the underside of boats here.</i>

46
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,784
A lot of the money in the budget
was reserved for digging up the topsoil...

47
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,201
<i>and moving it somewhere else.</i>

48
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:03,656
<i>So we thought, what if we covered</i>
<i>the entire ground with a wooden deck?</i>

49
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,831
<i>Then we can leave the soil as it is.</i>

50
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,373
<i>We put up this sheet.</i>

51
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,747
If you want more program over here,
we'll just lift the deck here.

52
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:16,205
If you want to park some boats here,
we store the boats underneath the...

53
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,678
So I think it had
this sense of possibility.

54
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,051
<i>These rolling hills next to the sea,</i>

55
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:26,348
<i>it also somehow inspires</i>
<i>movement and playfulness.</i>

56
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,062
<i>We won the competition</i>
<i>for the Maritime Youth House.</i>

57
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,988
<i>We found a lot of ways</i>
<i>to solve the problems</i>

58
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,950
<i>in a completely unproblematic way.</i>

59
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,579
<i>Even though it's a very small building,</i>
<i>with a small budget,</i>

60
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:52,002
<i>I think it had an impact,</i>
<i>and it won a handful of awards.</i>

61
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,706
<i>And I think it showed</i>

62
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,255
<i>that even something that is essentially</i>
<i>like a hut for boy scouts,</i>

63
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,840
which is typically more like
a barrack building,

64
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,546
like sort of off the shelf,
almost like a trailer,

65
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,678
that's what it normally is,

66
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:11,185
and with the same resources you could get
something that was completely different.

67
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,980
I think that definitely opened people's
way of thinking about architecture,

68
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,487
what a building could be
and what it could do.

69
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,372
[director]<i> So what happened this week?</i>

70
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,292
[Bjarke] <i>Me and my partner here,</i>
<i>at the New York office, Thomas,</i>

71
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:35,092
<i>went to London to Kensington Gardens,</i>
<i>next to the Serpentine Lake.</i>

72
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,668
<i>For the last 15 years,</i>

73
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:43,175
the Serpentine Gallery--
they have been making a pavilion,

74
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,590
the Serpentine Pavilion.

75
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,307
So, in the middle of Hyde Park
over the summer,

76
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,980
from June to end of October.

77
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:58,193
<i>The Serpentine Gallery</i>
<i>is almost like an icon</i>

78
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,855
<i>for miniature architectural manifestos.</i>

79
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:07,834
It's always commissioned to an architect
that has never built in England before.

80
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:14,289
And today, two thirds of the people
that design these pavilions...

81
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,745
<i>are Pritzker Prize-winning architects.</i>
<i>They're really at the top of their game.</i>

82
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,469
For a comedian, it's like performing
at <i>Saturday Night Live </i>or...

83
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:27,136
It's a stage where the history
of the people that have performed there

84
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,850
makes it an honor in itself.

85
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:38,024
<i>And we met with</i>
<i>the co-directors of the Serpentine</i>

86
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,896
and they started the meeting
by telling us that the good news was

87
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,994
that we would be designing
this year's Serpentine Pavilion.

88
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,543
I guess that was Tuesday
and today is Friday.

89
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,247
Without having any sort of design in mind,
imagine this sort of logic

90
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,750
where you have some kind of undulation,

91
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,377
so it almost like looks
like a marble curtain,

92
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,215
and that's what gives it stability.

93
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,352
Almost like a James Turrell.

94
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,348
That you're inside this weird translucent,
undulating slice of marble

95
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,313
and then you're looking up through...

96
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,853
I think with the dome...

97
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,017
I mean, it creates that one experience
of being inside,

98
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,936
and it's probably a beautiful optic
from the outside,

99
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,357
but that's only that one use.

100
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,528
You're doing an entire building
within six months.

101
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,285
<i>Normally a project that goes fast</i>
<i>takes six years,</i>

102
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:39,212
<i>so we're going to try to see</i>
<i>how many ideas we can crank out.</i>

103
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,339
I mean, there was something interesting

104
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,011
about like making a wall
that morphs to become a pavilion.

105
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,679
You know, it could be a way
of making a wall

106
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:56,023
that creates a cave,
and an auditorium, right?

107
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,021
[Thomas] Yeah.

108
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,728
It's more like a magical manipulation
of a conventional element...

109
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,856
[Thomas] Mm-hmm.

110
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,072
that then becomes space.

111
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:08,954
Cool?

112
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,662
[in Danish]<i> </i>Let's do it!

113
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,919
I'm Elisabet Ingels.

114
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,455
And I'm Knud Bundgaard Jensen.

115
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,642
And this is Fidel. He's a Bichon Havanese.

116
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,389
And it's Bjarke
who had given him the name.

117
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,814
-He's from Cuba.
-Cuba.

118
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:44,233
We couldn't call him Cuba,
because there's a Cuba down the street.

119
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,355
Another dog.

120
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:49,362
Yeah another dog, and so it's Fidel.

121
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:57,250
[Knud] He was drawing very much.
It was his great interest.

122
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:04,504
He was considering making comics
until 18, 19 years.

123
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,586
[director] What did you think

124
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,720
when he told you he was
gonna study architecture?

125
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,048
-Actually--
-It's a family project.

126
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,682
-Yes--
-[director] So explain.

127
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:20,766
We told Bjarke,
"You can later try making comics,

128
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:25,822
you can later get a job
at an advertising bureau,

129
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,899
but I think that you should
study architecture."

130
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,037
[Bjarke]<i> I went to Architecture school</i>
<i>in Barcelona.</i>

131
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,408
<i>I wanted to use some of the first years</i>

132
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:43,116
<i>where you get some basic education</i>
<i>in drawing to become a better cartoonist.</i>

133
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,585
<i>You end up in the school,</i>
<i>you want to figure this thing out.</i>

134
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,431
<i>So I went through this sort of</i>
<i>intellectual, serial-monogamy,</i>

135
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,680
<i>falling in love with one architect.</i>
<i>then the next, and next...</i>

136
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,273
<i>And it completely warped my idea</i>
<i>of what architecture could be.</i>

137
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,651
<i>And that was definitely the year where</i>
<i>I became the person I am today.</i>

138
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,494
Getting out of Copenhagen, living in
another city, speaking another language.

139
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,742
<i>And finally, dropping out of school,</i>

140
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,119
<i>starting my own company in Barcelona</i>
<i>with some friends.</i>

141
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,713
<i>It was also clear that when I returned</i>
<i>to Copenhagen a year later,</i>

142
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,169
with sort of a Spanish suntan,

143
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,000
I was a completely different person

144
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:33,546
<i>and could somehow do things</i>
<i>and be credible making statements</i>

145
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,393
<i>that would have been unimaginable</i>
<i>the year before.</i>

146
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,432
[Bjarke on video] The qualities of
the spaces and the indoor climate

147
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,307
doesn't come from the machine room,

148
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:49,404
but from the qualities
integrated into the architecture.

149
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,235
Rather than architecture
without architects,

150
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,621
it's sort of engineering without engines,

151
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,869
or Functionalism 2.0.

152
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,372
<i>We started our company</i>
<i>without any clients.</i>

153
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:11,303
But after a very long and winding road,
we finally ended up building a building.

154
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,628
<i>The VM House.</i>

155
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,135
<i>My name is Per Høpfner. I am a developer.</i>

156
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,640
<i>I meet Bjarke, first time in 2001.</i>

157
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,810
He said, "We are a new company,
architect company,

158
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,185
we are so fucking good,
and we are very creative,

159
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,653
and we are so bright,
and we can build very, very cheap."

160
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,275
"Okay, how cheap?"

164
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,962

<i>it should be very cheap,</i>

165
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,340
<i>and there could be something special.</i>

166
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,880
[Bjarke]<i> We designed</i>
<i>these buildings for pioneers.</i>

167
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:03,972
<i>We got permission</i>
<i>to make the apartments 30% deeper,</i>

168
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,477
<i>and we made sure that each apartment</i>
<i>had a double-height space.</i>

169
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:16,572
<i>For every three floors,</i>
<i>there was only one central corridor,</i>

170
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:21,742
<i>so that, instead of having a corridor</i>
<i>at every level that you had to pay for,</i>

171
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:26,374
<i>we boiled it down to every third level,</i>
<i>so we could get great efficiencies.</i>

172
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:33,293
The beautiful thing is that at this point,
we hadn't built as much as a dog house.

173
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,430
[Høpfner]
<i>And the day we started to sell here,</i>

174
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:46,098
we have sold 110 flats for one Sunday.

175
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,022
[Bjarke] <i>It created a lot of noise.</i>

176

[Høpfner] <i>And I can tell you one thing.</i>

177
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,161
A lot of his colleagues,
they don't like him.

178
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:06,409
And they don't like him because
they've been so successful abroad.

[Bjarke] <i>We were definitely seen as being</i>
<i>alien in a sort of Danish context.</i>

181
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:24,601

00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,196

<i>We have been keeping</i>
<i>a series of ideas alive.</i>

192
00:13:56,127 --> 00:14:00,007
<i>For a while we had three,</i>
<i>then we boiled it down to two.</i>

193
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,932
<i>And I think we are looking</i>

194

<i>that is made out of</i>
<i>fiberglass bricks or blocks.</i>

195
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,229
And then you're almost pulling it apart,

<i>so that it becomes undulating landscapes</i>
<i>on the exterior,</i>

<i>like a valley and a hillside.</i>

198
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:21,281
And then on the inside, it creates
this crevasse, or canyon, or cave.

199
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,281
So try to place this...

200

-[colleague 1] This one is lower.
-[colleague 2] That one should fit, yeah.

It's the kind of shit we do.

206
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,045
And I think it's also
the one we have developed the furthest.

207
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,767
There's a couple different ways
we can put it together.

208
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,935
I have a feeling that we could do this
and it would be a great success.

209
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,191
Yeah.

210
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,862
There's almost nothing
that wouldn't be cool about it.

211
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,529
Maybe we should just do it.

212

[Bjarke] <i>The way you realize</i>

00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,246
[fast-paced music]

216
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,710
<i>The master plan of this whole neighborhood</i>

217
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:27,137
<i>was basically saying to build</i>
<i>a stack of apartments</i>

218
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:30,098
<i>and then a big box of parking behind.</i>

219
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:38,597
<i>So we got this idea:</i>
<i>What if the parking fills the entire site?</i>

220
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,858
<i>And then instead of having</i>
<i>a vertical stack of homes,</i>

221
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,821
they become houses with gardens,

222
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:49,822
like a giant staircase covering
a big sort of mountain of parking.

223
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:55,871
<i>What we see here</i>
<i>is all the sun-facing gardens,</i>

224
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,334
where each home has a garden

225
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,207
<i>that is roughly the same size</i>
<i>as the apartment itself.</i>

226
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,842
<i>And then they sit on</i>
<i>this cave full of cars.</i>

227
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,142
The underside actually becomes

228
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,720
<i>the front door of the homes</i>
<i>of people arriving</i>

229
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,977
so we made the underside
very, very colorful.

230
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,780
<i>Whenever we design homes,</i>

231
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,910
I'm also thinking about myself:
What would I think would be amazing?

232
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,081
<i>And I think in this case,</i>
<i>it's almost like realizing a dream</i>

233
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,461
that an apartment block doesn't have to
look like a big, boxy slab.

234
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:43,589
It could be like
this sort of man-made mountain.

235
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,550
<i>You don't have to choose</i>
<i>between building a parking structure</i>

236
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,885
<i>or an apartment building.</i>

237
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,389
<i>You don't have to choose</i>
<i>between a house with a garden</i>

238
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,812
<i>or having a penthouse view.</i>

239
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,730
<i>You can actually have both.</i>

240
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:02,438
And once you force these sort of seemingly
mutually exclusive concepts together,

241
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:07,362
you actually get a new hybrid
that somehow ends up looking different

242
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,113
because it performs differently.

243
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,500
<i>I think The Mountain is</i>
<i>a quite good example of pragmatic utopia</i>

244
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,040
<i>in the sense that it's done</i>
<i>within one city block,</i>

245
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,970
<i>so it becomes a very pragmatic realization</i>
<i>of something utopian</i>

246
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,718
<i>but, like, one block at a time.</i>

247
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,136
<i>When I think</i>
<i>just that The Mountain is here,</i>

248
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,354
<i>it means that there is another way,</i>
<i>there is another possibility.</i>

249
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,395
And therefore
it makes the utopia more possible.

250
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,188
<i>And that's what we mean with </i>Yes Is More.

251
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,028
At that point,
I'd never really written it down,

252
00:17:56,117 --> 00:18:00,037
so it existed in the form of lectures,
verbal tradition.

253
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,581
[inaudible dialogue]

254
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,634
Yes Is More <i>is presented</i>
<i>in the form of a comic book.</i>

255
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:10,047
<i>It's not like you have the text first,</i>
<i>and then you get the pictures.</i>

256
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:14,591
<i>You have the things intertwined</i>
<i>so it becomes more conversational.</i>

257
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,179
So then of course, in retrospect,

258
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,393
it feels quite logical,

259
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,852
because I wanted
to become a graphic novelist

260
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,313
and I kind of deviated
from that trajectory at some point,

261
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,725
it's kind of a return to home.

262
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:33,779
[Martinussen]<i> The book very rapidly</i>
<i>gave him the position as a rising star.</i>

<i>asking the Danes:</i>

266
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,514
what is it actually that we want to do

267
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:58,302
from having had
this spectacular tradition?

268
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,684
<i>How can we be revolutionary,</i>

269
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,646
<i>but in such a manner that you would not</i>
<i>forget your tradition?</i>

270
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,649
So for instance, the building
that we are standing in right now

271
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,362
is actually a building which is,
in itself, a merger.

<i>a three-dimensional community.</i>

279
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:44,596

-Yeah, <i>Yes Is More</i>!
-for a month and a half.

So we ended up resulting in this
amazing comic book and exhibition,

308
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,203

that was actually the time

309

And he was so young, by the standards
of a world-renowned architect,

<i>that he had to go from being</i>
<i>a scrappy, young architect</i>

[Bjarke] <i>There was</i>

and maybe I just felt like

378
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,400
The Royal Parks are our landlords
and this is their beautiful park

379
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:59,118
and they stipulate that the architecture

380
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:02,121
cannot come
within three meters of the tree.

381
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:05,254
Now that of course
is not a problem in principle,

382
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,832
but it is a problem in practice.

383
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,497
So the question is,
is this three meters?

384
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:14,166
This is like, one, two, three.
In my mind, we can nudge it.

385
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:20,264

Yeah.

387
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,977
So you need another meter?

388
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,138
I think if we just--

389
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,766
And then we don't take it
a meter away from the fence?

390
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,944
Take it a meter away from the fence
and move it closer to the signature line.

391
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,738
But the other thing
that I am seriously curious about

392
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,529
is actually when you're standing here

393
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:40,082
and you imagine that you would
basically take the two yellow outlines

394
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,329
and literally flip them,

395
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,911
and I think we simply turn the other way.

396
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,917
-And then we move it--
-So it comes out...

397
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,499
It grazes the path

398
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,797
and then the entire hill is gonna be
in the sun, which is also nice.

00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:17,407
you have two shadows
on the walls in the back

479
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:22,666
because the sun is there above the trees,
and it's also right there below the wheat.

480
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,748
<i>And both suns throw shadows,</i>

481
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,967
<i>so you have this amazing moment</i>
<i>where the sky has two suns.</i>

482
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,509
Or at least the view has two suns,
which is quite nice.

483
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:38,515
<i>And then actually another funny thing,</i>
<i>in the winter, the water freezes.</i>

484
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:43,857
And suddenly the lake,
which was normally the end of the garden,

485
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,899
became this public square

486
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,192
where every single kid,
touching on the lake from all sides,

487
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,277
<i>would come and ice skate.</i>

488
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:56,334
So just like this interesting idea
that maybe just the seasonality of things,

489
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:00,659
or that suddenly something
that was a barrier became a meeting point.

490
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,464
<i>What changes over time</i>
<i>is that naïveté fades away,</i>

491
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:12,048
<i>but it's replaced by another kind</i>
<i>of confidence</i>

492
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,683
<i>that will make you better</i>
<i>at seizing the moment</i>

493
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,265
<i>and grasping what's important.</i>

494
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,975
Okay, let's-- let's sit down.

[Bjarke in Danish] Yes, but I don't think

[Bjarke] Oh, Fidel.
Can you shut the fuck up, dear Fidel?

504
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,720
[Bjarke in English] <i>There's a sense</i>
<i>it's hard to make it in your own village,</i>

505
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,433
<i>but if you go to the big city</i>
<i>and make it there,</i>

506
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,234
<i>then, "Ah, it's one of us. He did it."</i>

507
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,570
<i>I think we also changed</i>
<i>people's mindset of what's possible,</i>

508
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:15,276
so I think Copenhageners
got used to more crazy ideas,

509
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,073
so when we actually presented

510
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:21,117
the idea of putting a giant ski slope
on the roof of a power plant,

511
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,332
I think it was in an environment

512
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:27,003
that we had already influenced
a little bit over the last decade,

513
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:32,633
so that it was receptive
to that kind of thinking.

514
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,353
<i>We felt that we could propose</i>
<i>something seemingly insane</i>

515
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,100
<i>and actually get away with it.</i>

516

<i>Copenhill.</i>

517

<i>A waste-to-energy power plant that has</i>
<i>a giant public park on the roof</i>

518
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,572
<i>where you can ski.</i>

519
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,318
<i>It's the tallest and biggest building</i>
<i>in Copenhagen.</i>

520
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:00,368
<i>It's, again, this idea</i>
<i>of environmental thinking,</i>

521
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,370
<i>that if you have a power plant</i>
<i>that is so clean</i>

522
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:05,963
<i>that you only have a little bit of CO2</i>

523
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:09,169
<i>and a little bit of steam coming out</i>
<i>of the chimney, but no toxins,</i>

524
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,551
<i>you literally have clean mountain air.</i>

525
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,968
<i>And instead of having to be</i>
<i>far away from it, you can enjoy it.</i>

526
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:24,222
[in Danish] It's quite amazing
that this will be the children's hill.

527
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,017
It begins all the way up there!

528
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,231
[builder 1 in Danish] It's high up,
even though it's the children's hill.

529
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,601
[builder 2 in Danish] Yeah, that's right.

530
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,476
It's too cool!

531
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,739
[Bjarke in English] <i>Of course you can say</i>

532
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,781
<i>you put an Alpine ski slope</i>
<i>on the roof of a building.</i>

533
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,735
<i>It's a building, it's not a mountain.</i>

534
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:50,461
<i>I think, to my relief, it feels</i>
<i>much more like being on a mountainside</i>

535
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,792
<i>than being on a roof.</i>

536
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:58,167
This is around 130 feet
and the top is 300.

537
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,896
The elevator arrives there
so that when you come out,

538
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,519
you have almost like a flat area here.

539
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,902
And then you sort of...

540
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,609
Then you just take off.

541
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:29,833
<i>I think a project like this can be</i>
<i>sort of a beacon in showing the world...</i>

542
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,537
<i>clean tech presents</i>
<i>almost utopian possibilities.</i>

543
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,090
<i>And I think the Steam Ring</i>
<i>is a powerful symbol of exactly that.</i>

544
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,563
<i>The chimney, instead of being</i>
<i>a symbol of pollution,</i>

545
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,390
<i>it becomes a celebration.</i>

546
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,191
<i>We've worked with Realities United</i>
<i>to design the chimney</i>

547
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,283
<i>so that it puffs rings of steam.</i>

548
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,114
<i>And it's also like somehow, like,</i>
<i>when you start this kind of journey,</i>

549
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,737
<i>it's, like, you know</i>
<i>what's important for you...</i>

550
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:10,123
<i>but you don't necessarily know</i>
<i>where you're going.</i>

551
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:14,212
<i>But you know that,</i>
<i>if you make the decision</i>

552
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,922
<i>based on these things</i>
<i>that you know matter to you,</i>

553
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,050
<i>wherever you're gonna end up,</i>
<i>it's where you need to go.</i>

554
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,721
Of course, I couldn't have predicted this
when we did this,

555
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,427
but they're definitely
sort of a similar spirit.

556
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,104
[director] Where's the Maritime
Youth House from here?

557
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,438
It's basically like...

558
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,356
You can see it
where the trees are, exactly.

559
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,824
And then you can see...

560
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:49,579
the Mountain and the VM are right there.

561
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,659
[director] What about the chapel?

562
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,210
That's right there.

563
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:02,879
This is probably
the most spectacular toilet experience

564
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,716
you can get in Copenhagen at this point.

565
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,761

566
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:16,015

<i>that are considered infrastructure:</i>

567
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,314
<i>highways, bridges, power plants...</i>

568
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,478
and crossbreed it,

569
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:25,488
so that it actually has positive
social and environmental side effects,

570
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:27,526
<i>like the power plant.</i>

571
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:33,959
<i>Those combinations are very powerful</i>
<i>because it's taking a very strong force,</i>

572
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,958
<i>which is necessity, utility,</i>

573
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:42,463
<i>and giving it poetry and possibility.</i>

574
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,853
There's something there
that can be taken much further.
