1
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,893
Humans have been making buildings

2
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,062
for thousands and thousands of years

3
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,273
with bricks and mortar,

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,900
and steel and glass.

5
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,364
But along with those materials,
we've also been developing

6
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,616
carbon fiber and plastics.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,203
And these materials
have left a mark on the planet.

8
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,542
Can we design our way out of this?

9
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,961
If we are to survive,

10
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,548
we must design our way out of this.

11
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,800
It's now on us

12
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,386
to decide where we're going from here.

13
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,353
The story begins with a Big Bang,

14
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,065
with the first tree,

15
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,816
with the first human.

16
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:11,446
It's a story about what happens
when nature and culture unite.

17
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,785
She's got huge ideas
for big change on a massive scale.

18
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,411
Neri Oxman.

19
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,122
Neri's work
redefines the relationship

20
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,791
between matter and environment.

21
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,669
Neri is the embodiment

22
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,130
of art, design, science, and engineering

23
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,381
in one person.

24
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,761
She does design
that involves new kinds of materials.

25
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:41,059
Doing what nature did,
but perhaps doing a better job.

26
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:45,021
And she's now at the threshold
of trying to show a new way.

27
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,194
What question do you get the most?

28
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,029
What the hell do I do?

29
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,374
My name is Neri...

30
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,503
and I am many things.

31
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,383
I grew up in Haifa, Israel.

32
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,678
I was trained as an architect,

33
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,639
educated as a medical doctor,

34
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,225
and I am now a professor at MIT.

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,522
We live in the most exciting time,

36
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,233
but also the scariest time for designers,

37
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,570
where everything material,
everything artificial,

38
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,240
can be designed at the scale
and sophistication of a cell.

39
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,536
My focus is designing new materials

40
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,372
for, with, and by nature.

41
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,088
Today, we can look at the world
in the resolution

42
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,465
almost of human consciousness.

43
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,676
From the very, very small scale,

44
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,012
the scale of particles
and the sub-atomic particles,

45
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,847
to atoms, nucleotides in the genome,

46
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,850
to cells, to the human mind,
to the Earth, to the solar system,

47
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:07,770
to the Milky Way, to the visible universe,
to maybe parallel universes.

48
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,441
Suddenly, the design and engineering

49
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,903
is happening with constituent parts

50
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,156
that are down at the atomic
and sub-atomic level.

51
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:22,911
Start to be able to do things
that only nature could do before.

52
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,871
That's pretty incredible.

53
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,584
This is really where
the future of design is going.

54
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,045
Good designers will act as alchemists

55
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,381
that mix and match atoms to bits,
to genes,

56
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,635
and scale up these techniques
and technologies.

57
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,346
But in order to build big,

58
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,224
we had to think small.

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,311
Machines, inventions,
power blackout the past.

60
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,855
Forget the quiet cities,
bring in the steam and steel,

61
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,607
the iron men, the giants.

62
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,110
Pillars of smoke by day, pillars of fire
by night, pillars of progress.

63
00:03:56,194 --> 00:04:00,823
The Industrial Age brought about
a kind of design thinking whereby,

64
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,117
because of the assembly line,

65
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,996
we tend to design products and buildings
and wearables

66
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,874
and even cities out of parts.

67
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,796
For thousands of years,
we have been making

68
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:19,092
and building things
with single purpose materials.

69
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,760
Glass for a window,

70
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,387
brick for load bearing,

71
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,888
wood for spanning.

72
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:29,352
But now comes an age where
new possibilities open up.

73
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,898
Neri has her model,
and the model is nature.

74
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,235
Nature is full of organisms

75
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,154
in which materials do these complex things

76
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,948
in a most efficient way.

77
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,493
Can we design robots
that spin silk?

78
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,830
These are the kinds of questions we ask.

79
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,555
Drawing, I think, is an act of meditation.

80
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,604
Because as you give it form
and you draw its lines

81
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,481
and its textures,

82
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,191
and then its colors,

83
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,403
it sort of tells you
what it wants to become.

84
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,283
I didn't realize
you were left-handed.

85
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,366
Yeah.

86
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,661
Does that mean anything?

87
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,289
They say they're more creative.

88
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,754
I'm drawing the next version of Aguahoja

89
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,423
for the Smithsonian in New York.

90
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:45,762
We will be designing
a bio-compatible structure

91
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,973
made entirely of materials
that are natural.

92
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,602
Like chitin, which can be found
in crustaceans like shrimp shells,

93
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,689
or pectin, which you can find
in lemons and the skin of apples.

94
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:01,944
The vision behind the project
is to completely omit

95
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,947
the use of plastics on planet Earth.

96
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,744
There is little structure in the beginning
when we start a project.

97
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,038
We sort of look in all directions.

98
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,417
And so, we would often,
for a single project,

99
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,045
have what we like to call
a library of experiments

100
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,549
where there would be dozens
and maybe hundreds of iterations

101
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,886
until we reach the right one
for a particular structure.

102
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,058
There is a beautiful saying in Hebrew.

103
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,815
Meaning "all is expected, all is known."

104
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,858
And permission is given to change

105
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,528
everything at any moment in time.

106
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,823
It's also how I work.

107
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,159
We have an idea,
we follow it until we change it.

108
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,788
And at any moment in time,
there is this permission

109
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,416
I give myself, but also
to any other member on the team,

110
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,585
to change the ideas
and change the project as they go.

111
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,885
The Mediated Matter group, which I lead,
is a lab within the MIT Media Lab.

112
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,222
For Neri to come to the Media Lab,

113
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,224
quite frankly, was destiny.

114
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,353
MIT Media Lab.

115
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,188
I had built a lab

116
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,066
that had to do
with the human-computer interface.

117
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,696
So, we did all these things
that were considered crazy at the time.

118
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,323
We had the first flat panel displays.

119
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,575
They were dismissed.

120
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:34,120
Working on touch,
that you would actually touch a display.

121
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,080
People thought that was very stupid.

122
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,916
We were in the School of Design,

123
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,127
so we had a certain license.

124
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,045
License to be weird.

125
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,675
The president of MIT at that time

126
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,178
was very interested in the arts.

127
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,848
He identified that MIT
was a very, very special place.

128
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,726
All of the technologies
were all being developed here.

129
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,437
I mean, heck, the coolest place
in the universe is at MIT.

130
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,940
Everything was being developed here.
And yet, there was...

131
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,901
there was this void.

132
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,738
The MIT president
was bemoaning the fact there was no lab

133
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:13,284
that mixed art and science
and engineering in some deep way.

134
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,871
And I said, "Jerry, I'll build you one."

135
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,874
MIT Media Lab.

136
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,671
The Media Lab is a place

137
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,799
where you have to think about things

138
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,552
50 years out, at least, or 100 years out.

139
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,970
If you're making something

140
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,557
that's applicable to the world today,
here, you're too late.

141
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:44,148
I was involved
with a lot of the last faculty hires

142
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,067
where we have to advertise.

143
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,529
And I put the word "misfit"
in the first sentence.

144
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,366
And even went further to say,
"If you can get a faculty position

145
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,327
in some other department
at some other university, go.

146
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,540
But if you can't, come see us."

147
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,251
I think we all live well in the weird.

148
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,628
This was the place.

149
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,714
This was the one and only place

150
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,883
to create what we've created.

151
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,053
Neri is perhaps the best example

152
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,555
of somebody who came

153
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,932
and then integrated herself

154
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,768
in the perfect intersection

155
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,104
of design, science, and engineering.

156
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:29,193
The way I think about the group
is a kind of Noah's Ark.

157
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,114
The ideal situation would be
to have two of both.

158
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,033
Two material scientists, two biologists.

159
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,303
- I'm a computer scientist by training.
- Graphic design.

160
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,579
Biomedical engineer.

161
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,331
Two product designers,
two computational scientists.

162
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,000
- Artificial life.
- Neuroscience.

163
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,543
- Two architects.
- Architecture.

164
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,919
Mechanical engineer.

165
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,589
But right now, we have to do
just about everything.

166
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,925
I came from a pretty hardcore
neurotechnology group.

167
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,720
But meeting Neri pretty much once

168
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,265
was enough to kind of change my mind
and my life course.

169
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,394
There's a feeling
when you interact with Neri

170
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,104
that you could wake up tomorrow

171
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,232
and come up with the craziest idea
that you could possibly think of

172
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,651
and it wouldn't be out
of the realm of possibility.

173
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,864
Her lab is populated
in the middle of the night, on weekends.

174
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,866
And guess what? She's there, too.

175
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,201
I design everything.

176
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,871
The team, their interactions.

177
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,456
They would hate hearing it,

178
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,125
but there is a big brother,

179
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,585
or a small mother.

180
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,268
We have this running joke
where the choice of font

181
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,313
is no less important
than the choice of a cell

182
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,981
whose genes are being hacked.

183
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,858
And, in the end,

184
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,736
great fonts will help create great genomes
and vice versa.

185
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,112
I truly believe in that.

186
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,242
In the beginning
when I started the research group,

187
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,870
there was great confusion,
and...

188
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,580
I think there still is.

189
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,666
I mean, it's all pretty weird.

190
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,627
But technology catches up
with the imagination,

191
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,880
and so, therefore,
imagination has responsibility.

192
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,591
I mean, we can learn to grow buildings.

193
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,723
Before I joined this group,
the main thing that we knew about Neri

194
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,602
was that her group had unleashed
6,500 silkworms in the lobby.

195
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,234
Silk Pavilion was
a three-meter diameter dome

196
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:37,196
that was built using 6,500 silkworms
that were Fed-Ex ordered

197
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,989
from an online silk farm,

198
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:44,286
and were, placed
on a robotically-spun fiber silk dome.

199
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,958
She is very much a source of,

200
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,002
you know, consternation
in our purchasing department.

201
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:57,007
MIT gets a little puzzled
when you order a few thousand silkworms.

202
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,469
We explored alternative ways

203
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,513
with which to build and manufacture

204
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,516
that are aligned with nature's way.

205
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,186
That is, growth as opposed to assembly.

206
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,648
I remember seeing it
being built by the worms.

207
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,109
And sort of, There was scaffolding,

208
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,611
and it was quite a...
quite an accomplishment.

209
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,741
In the silk industry,
we are very accustomed

210
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,993
to boiling the silk cocoons

211
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,328
in order to unravel the silk.

212
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,331
And in that process,
we kill all those silkworms.

213
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,129
And with Silk Pavilion,
we came up with this approach

214
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:39,175
of cohabiting and co-fabricating
at the same time.

215
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,513
And so, the cycle of life
we capitulated on this project

216
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,724
as the product was being created.

217
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,311
I have rarely had Neri
talk to me about anything

218
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,854
and seen it coming.

219
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,316
And a lot of her sensibility is...
is that,

220
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,485
how do you bring the unexpected in,

221
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,488
but then get it to surprise you
in a... in a wonderful way?

222
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,711
We're doing another
Silk Pavilion installation.

223
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,254
Do you remember that?

224
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,466
And so, we're working
on a lot of exhibitions.

225
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,637
And I'm thinking about how to bring
the work to the next level

226
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,265
that would be more practice-oriented.

227
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,101
Less research-oriented,
more practice-oriented

228
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,354
and more real world deployment.

229
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,525
I miss Israel
mostly when I'm there,

230
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,236
because I'm so nostalgic
about that country

231
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,446
and what it was, what it symbolized.

232
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,491
I always tell my team,

233
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,370
"You have to go away
to come back home.

234
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:55,459
You'll never really truly have a sense
of home until you leave home."

235
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,840
But when you come back and smell the air,

236
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,051
you go back all the way to childhood.

237
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,600
I have so many friends
who would never go back to childhood.

238
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,644
I would in a second.

239
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,647
Like now, I'm ready to be three again.

240
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,194
I remember as a kid growing up,

241
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,780
waking up in the middle
of the stormy night.

242
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:30,119
I could hear the wind blowing
against this very old terrace

243
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,871
that... that I had in my bedroom.

244
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,542
And I remember opening it
and seeing all this white stuff.

245
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,715
And it all felt so incredibly magical.

246
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:50,472
And I remember grabbing
a piece of that substance, that matter,

247
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,183
and putting it into a plastic bag,

248
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,935
and putting it under my pillow,

249
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,812
and waiting to show my parents

250
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,106
this magical material
that fell from the sky.

251
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,111
And I remember waking up
in this wet bed,

252
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,698
and being so extremely disappointed
and trying to make sense of it all.

253
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,579
And I think that sense of awe
and wonder that I had as a three-year-old

254
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,291
that never saw or experienced snow
stayed with me.

255
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,672
And that innocence is still there.

256
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,928
I hope it's still there.

257
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,349
What's that?

258
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,809
- Is this yours?
- What?

259
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,686
- What's on the screen.
- Yeah.

260
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,647
That's cool. This is for Aguahoja?

261
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,024
This is a process that starts with nothing

262
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,692
and it grows across it.

263
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,654
The idea being that we're kind of used
to working with things that grow.

264
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,448
Like, that's what we do as a group,
is we direct the growth.

265
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,574
That looks great.

266
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,202
What's nice about this organism
is you can stop its growth,

267
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,871
and then start it again
if you just add some moisture.

268
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,041
- Pick that up and hold it for a second.
- That would be... Okay.

269
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,378
- So, that's pectin.
- Then move your finger out of the way.

270
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,461
Yeah.

271
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,425
- Yeah.
- So, it's a thermochromic compound

272
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,010
that I mixed in with the pectin.

273
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,638
That's awesome,
because it looks like paper, Josh.

274
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,724
Yeah. And so, you can touch it,
and it will also respond to heat.

275
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,644
So, it'll change color
back to the regular pectin color

276
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,063
at, um, 86 degrees Fahrenheit.

277
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,023
- And it is translucent?
- Yep.

278
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,566
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.

279
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,776
- Yeah.
- Okay.

280
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,820
That's incredible progress.

281
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,905
I love a good verb.

282
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,825
In fact,
I think all nouns should be verbs,

283
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,327
including "naturing"
as opposed to "nature."

284
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,873
I often ask, "How can we nature
this building into being?"

285
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,794
Also, Mother Nature, we have
the responsibility to mother nature.

286
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,380
Not consider it as boundless,

287
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:50,509
but rather as an entity
that is now crying for love.

288
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,019
We are in Haifa,

289
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,604
the third largest city in Israel.

290
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,109
To me, if Jerusalem is about religion

291
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,653
and Tel Aviv is about the street culture,

292
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,613
Haifa is about nature.

293
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,911
I knew her in Haifa, growing up.

294
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,498
I think of my childhood,
and I think Neri does too,

295
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,835
of having had the privilege to grow up
in something magical.

296
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,298
In Haifa, the mountains
rise right out of the sea,

297
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,675
and they have a...

298
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,635
a very rich plant life.

299
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,348
And so, we always lived
right next to nature.

300
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:44,605
My grandmother
had a ginormous garden.

301
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,985
It was on the top of a beautiful mountain
called Mount Carmel,

302
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,197
where we could see the sea.

303
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,367
The garden had fig trees, apple trees,

304
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,329
poppy seeds, various types of birds.

305
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,792
The quality of the sun, the outdoors,

306
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,753
the smell of the pine nuts.

307
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,089
It was my Garden of Eden.

308
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,428
And then at 18, the army, boom.

309
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,102
She was a lieutenant
in the Israeli Air Force.

310
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,189
You enter the army,

311
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,399
and you're faced with death

312
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,568
at a very, very early age.

313
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,073
I saw everything
when I was in the military.

314
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,156
Everything.

315
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,746
I saw the extremes of the human spirit.

316
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,543
Many things that I'll never, ever share.

317
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,255
And that had a great effect on me.

318
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,637
You're faced with an internal conflict.

319
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,641
The duality of wanting to protect...

320
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,601
your identity,

321
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,186
but also wanting

322
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,897
to embrace other identities.

323
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,697
The discovery of innocence is its loss.

324
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,199
And...

325
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,245
that is perhaps
the ultimate Israeli experience.

326
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,416
From the gutsy Israeli thing,

327
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:31,378
she has a kind of gutsy confidence

328
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,840
that allows her to be very adventurous
with her thoughts.

329
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,977
There is the myth
that Einstein and Picasso

330
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,646
met in 1904 in Paris.

331
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,444
Picasso started the Cubist movement.

332
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,407
Einstein,
the General Theory of Relativity.

333
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:05,454
Both were asking questions
about space and time.

334
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:10,250
And one expressed himself
through painting and sculpture,

335
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,753
the other through a mathematical theorem.

336
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,216
But they were both questioning
the world around us.

337
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,513
Usually, art is for expression,

338
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,974
science is for exploration,

339
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,185
engineering is for invention,

340
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,437
and design is for communication.

341
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,817
And I thought, "Why can't we take
these four squares

342
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,362
and create a circle out of them,
a clock...

343
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,950
where you're constantly moving
or shifting

344
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,701
from one domain to another?"

345
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,207
And the input for one domain
becomes the output for another.

346
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,911
So, if you think of science,

347
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,878
science converts information
into knowledge.

348
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,840
And engineering
converts knowledge into utility.

349
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:04,846
And design converts utility
into cultural behavior and context.

350
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,017
And then art
is taking that cultural behavior

351
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,353
and questions our perception of the world.

352
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,691
It shows that there is
sort of a flow of information,

353
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,735
a flow of creativity that happens
across all disciplines.

354
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,739
And I do think the more
I spend time in this lab,

355
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,115
the more I venture
into the different areas.

356
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,576
And if you believe
in the Cinderella moment,

357
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,828
in the twelve o'clock,

358
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,914
in that place, in the midnight hour,

359
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,166
you know, it's where Picasso
meets Einstein.

360
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,626
Art meets science.

361
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,505
Changes in our perception
affect the way we capture data,

362
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,091
and can only happen

363
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,759
if you believe in magic.

364
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,471
It can only happen
if you can suspend your disbelief.

365
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:55,188
I tell the team members,
"You have to be ready for your project

366
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,150
to appear in the atrium
of the Museum of Modern Art,

367
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,944
and at the same time,
on the cover of Nature and Science.

368
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,197
We don't do either. It's always both.

369
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,052
I like the art side because that's
when things get totally out of hand.

370
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,513
You don't know if people are gonna try
to touch your structure

371
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,539
or if they're gonna say
that it smells funny.

372
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,768
That's kind of the magical moment because
that's when everyone gets to understand

373
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,128
how they feel about the thing
that you've made.

374
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,300
We have used artistic venues

375
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:28,764
to promote some of
the riskiest science ideas we've ever had,

376
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,768
where they get the cover
of, "That's art."

377
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,980
Some of the greatest
first scientists

378
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,149
would have been considered artists today.

379
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,320
When Darwin went in 1831
on the HMS Beagle,

380
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,156
he brought with him a book
of color nomenclatures.

381
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,077
All great designs
were myths, right?

382
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,873
Da Vinci's flying machine is an expression
of the myth of Icarus.

383
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,502
Prometheus and the liver being devoured

384
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,630
was this myth of organ regeneration.

385
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,632
So, in a way, through their mythologies,

386
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,093
they were also expressing
scientific knowledge.

387
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,850
So, these look like anatomical drawings,

388
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,561
scientific, anatomical drawings,

389
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,022
that are entirely made of glass,

390
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,316
created in the late 1880s

391
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,445
by a father and son
that have dedicated their life

392
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,114
to the art of glass.

393
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:32,285
They produced 4,000 glass models

394
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,871
depicting 780 species.

395
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,375
It's... it's still unclear,

396
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,752
to artists and scientists alike,

397
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:44,548
how they managed to arrive
at that granularity.

398
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:49,344
And many have tried to replicate
this art form and have failed.

399
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,637
It's a mystery.

400
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,057
So, we came here to study the glass

401
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,685
and to better understand how this...

402
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,146
how this resolution was achieved.

403
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,405
I don't know that we've ever
taken on a project

404
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,283
that did not involve
the creation of a new technology.

405
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,495
Glass, that's an ancient material.

406
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,040
It's been formed, it's been blown,
it's been pressed,

407
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,500
but it hasn't been printed.

408
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:25,088
So, we wanted to create the first
optically transparent glass printer.

409
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:36,975
Wow.

410
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,602
- Stop here.
- Okay.

411
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,395
It's a shock,
'cause you can't get...

412
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,398
- It's sort of in a runaway mode right now.
- Yeah.

413
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,484
Printing glass sounds simple,

414
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,362
but to do it, you have to do
lots of things that are very complicated.

415
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,364
She'll design a new mathematics

416
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,742
for the flow of glass
coming out of the nozzle,

417
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,452
and then she'll work with them

418
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,496
on exactly how they need
to organize this thing

419
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,790
to make this beautiful,
but also structurally stable.

420
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,672
It's moving
in an unexpected way.

421
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,842
Quickly dropping the temperature.
Not sure that's gonna do it.

422
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,143
The first printer
was rather primitive.

423
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:24,564
Glass II allowed us
to incorporate a rotary unit

424
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:29,653
to orient the nozzle
according to the force-feed direction,

425
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,821
a little bit like a calligraphy pen.

426
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,034
It's a much more sophisticated system

427
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:41,248
that allowed us to print three
three-meter columns for Milan Design Week.

428
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,427
There are probably
some skeptics about...

429
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,347
"And how does this help me feed my family?

430
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,141
How does this help my company
produce better products?"

431
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,771
You don't get to the idea
of having a smartphone with no buttons

432
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,939
by A/B testing.

433
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,941
You get that through being inspired

434
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,264
and... and coming up
with something completely different.

435
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,862
Imagine...

436
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,740
a world that is not composed of parts.

437
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,200
Something very complex,

438
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,036
something like your camera
could grow from a seed.

439
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,039
That's preposterous.

440
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:28,169
But even if it's so preposterous
that it doesn't happen that way

441
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,589
that you plant a seed
and a camera comes out,

442
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,257
it almost doesn't matter

443
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,511
if there's this enormous richness
of ideas and projects

444
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,097
and discoveries along the way.

445
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,224
We often find ourselves

446
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,936
creating solutions for problems
we don't yet know exist.

447
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,522
Rather than problem solve,
we problem seek.

448
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,150
The payoff is

449
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,110
things that affect our lives day to day.

450
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:57,991
The advantage of printing glass
is that you can create optical lenses

451
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,453
and control how solar energy

452
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,873
is processed through the skin
of the building.

453
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,043
And that's the one technology
that takes us now, finally,

454
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,337
to the architectural scale, for real.

455
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,924
We can get to build
a glass-printed skyscraper.

456
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,017
We work on technology

457
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,103
that is so intimately connected
with the natural environment,

458
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,273
but we end up spending most of our time
at the lab.

459
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,903
And so, I often find myself

460
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,114
torn between my life as a lab rat

461
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,576
and being out there in nature
and just breathing it all in.

462
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:09,062
This is Walden Pond,
the very same place that Thoreau lived

463
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,480
and wrote about.

464
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,826
There was a time
when I used to come here every morning.

465
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,375
You think design
is the practice of letting go...

466
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:35,255
in a similar way in which Thoreau
and the Transcendentalists

467
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:38,466
let go of all that is unnecessary.

468
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,389
Here,

469
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,810
it's a pocket of nature
surrounded by the city.

470
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,856
When you close your eyes...

471
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,155
you can hear the plane, you can hear
the cars, you can hear the train,

472
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,698
you're literally in the city.

473
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,617
It's almost like an inverted lab.

474
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,750
There's something that reminds me
of Haifa, that reminds me of home.

475
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,215
There are different ways
of communicating with nature.

476
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,051
There's a connection
that happens in Walden Pond,

477
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,471
and there's a connection
that happens in our wet lab.

478
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,477
Here, it's just like being in the garden.

479
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,271
It is a garden.
It's just a different kind of garden.

480
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,940
I love it.

481
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,656
Our next Aguahoja deadline is coming up

482
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,575
when we're installing the next structure

483
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,744
at the Cooper Hewitt Museum
in New York City.

484
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,579
- What is that?
- It's, casein,

485
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,830
a kind of milk protein.

486
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,208
This is casein?

487
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,251
- Yeah.
- Milkshake.

488
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,338
That's crazy. Did you test it?
Did you load test it?

489
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,798
- Yeah.
- How does it be...

490
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,716
Really well. It's... it's...

491
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,427
a few times stronger
than the photopolymer we use.

492
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,096
In the current research
around Aguahoja,

493
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,183
we're looking into the design of decay.

494
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,812
Casein is a milk protein
and is biodegradable,

495
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,688
and yet as hard as concrete.

496
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,149
I think we're really, like,
into the idea

497
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,443
that the whole thing can decay
and go back to nature.

498
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,862
Maybe this combination would work

499
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,490
for something that's structurally sound.

500
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,285
Everyone who picked it up
thought this was plastic. No, it's not.

501
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:33,832
Anything made of plastic today
can be replaced with those biopolymers.

502
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,709
We should think about the bigger narrative

503
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:41,089
and how to think about the decay
in... in... in... in a meaningful way.

504
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,010
I loved the biological sciences,

505
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:50,473
and I was certain
I was going to become a surgeon.

506
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,017
It just made sense.

507
00:30:55,687 --> 00:31:00,108
I remember the first dissection session
we had in anatomy.

508
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,027
I remember always...

509
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,573
doing something
I was never allowed to do. That is...

510
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,200
going behind the body
and taking a look at the face

511
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:13,746
of this incredible and wonderful creature
that gave their body to science.

512
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,961
And saying a little prayer
for that person and for science.

513
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,382
Then, my grandmother passed away,

514
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,176
and that day,
I decided to switch to architecture.

515
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,972
It just felt meaningless

516
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,142
to keep on going at that point
without her.

517
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:38,980
I felt I... I... I needed to keep
that legacy of the garden going.

518
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,277
At architecture school,
there were rules and guidelines

519
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,945
that every architect is taught.

520
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,531
But these are all interpretations of...

521
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:53,786
our levels of controlling nature
and controlling the natural environment.

522
00:31:56,247 --> 00:32:01,711
Design, whose purpose is to beautify
and prettify the world, will not survive.

523
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,926
It is a delusion
that we're alone in this world.

524
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:12,889
That the design practice of the future
should have zero clients.

525
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,059
Nature should be the single client.

526
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,438
I mean, Neri's ambitious,
no question about it.

527
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,983
You don't win awards
if you do what people tell you to do.

528
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,986
You win by questioning authority
and thinking for yourself.

529
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,075
An engineer said to me,

530
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,868
"You want to build, no?

531
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,245
Biology will take you nowhere."

532
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,478
Hi! how are you?

533
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,854
Come and sit down.

534
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:07,151
My parents were and are
both great architects.

535
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,031
There was always a supply of inspiration.

536
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,492
This was a fish made of a shoe,

537
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,036
which I think kind of says

538
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,039
everything about Neri's... Neri herself.

539
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,459
This is a reprint
of the New York Times article,

540
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,837
and what they did was they...

541
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:32,010
put Neri on the cover
of the Art and Culture magazine,

542
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,845
and then, on the inside,

543
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:37,807
they used that quotation,
“The Leonardo da Vinci of today.”

544
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,100
So embarrassing.

545
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:45,815
Self-confidence provided her
with the ability to fly, you know?

546
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,067
She flew. She's flying now.

547
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,367
I left Israel to grow

548
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,162
and seek my identity.

549
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,672
I've always wanted to have children,
never had the opportunity.

550
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,341
I hope I will someday.

551
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:18,139
Many of my friends have told me
that it's impossible,

552
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,683
that I can't do it all.

553
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,188
I still think it's possible.

554
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,740
As I've grown,

555
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:40,078
and I move forward into more recent work,

556
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,455
we're getting closer to nature.

557
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,833
The arc begins with nature-inspired design

558
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,504
and ends with design-inspired nature.

559
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,934
I.. I love bees.

560
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,938
Yeah, I like bees.
I raised bees in my youth.

561
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,779
She's... she's into this, the bees.

562
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,866
They are nature's architects.

563
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,874
Initially, we were looking
at swarm construction because...

564
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,961
we can either build really big robots
to make really big things,

565
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,564
or you can have multiple small robots
that are working together.

566
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:37,093
You can't print a structure on Mars
with a single robot.

567
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,388
You have to have a bunch of robots
that interact.

568
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,059
So, that's when we started
to get interested in bees.

569
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:50,064
From bees, we can learn so much
about social interaction.

570
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:54,235
But in Massachusetts,
they're pretty active during the summer.

571
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,113
And then, afterwards,
it really goes downhill,

572
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,489
because then it gets cold,

573
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,658
and when the frost starts to appear,
that's it.

574
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,871
One experiment
often leads to another.

575
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,249
And it ended up trying
to figure out can we make an indoor space

576
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,335
where we trick them into thinking
that it's spring all year round,

577
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,588
so we have a perpetual spring environment.

578
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,507
We rented a space
outside of the Media Lab.

579
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,887
We started with a warehouse,
and then we built it up.

580
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,646
The magical formula is knowing

581
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,523
when to say why,

582
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,318
and with the same breath, ask why not.

583
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,571
So, the space requires

584
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,742
knowing exactly what kind
of thermal control you need, and air,

585
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,368
and how can you mimic artificial light

586
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,996
to trick the bees
into thinking that it's spring.

587
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,585
The place that we built was really nice
because it was always, like, 70 degrees

588
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,753
and very humid.

589
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,632
But the sound of about a million bees

590
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,760
over a winter was eerie.

591
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,019
The next step is a robotic queen

592
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,604
that can spit pheromones

593
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,941
and inform a highly social community

594
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,734
how to place their comb

595
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,320
and what quality of honey to produce,

596
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:23,282
but keep them alive, keep them healthy,
keep them replenished or planted.

597
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,618
I'm still looking for the queen.

598
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,873
The queen is bigger,

599
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,292
slightly lighter...

600
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,797
and different odor.

601
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,131
So, she...

602
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,925
If we could smell,

603
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,387
spits out those pheromones,
controlling the entire hive.

604
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:57,817
You have to question yourself
in order to create.

605
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:03,406
And, actually, when you say, "I wonder,"
the source of the word is doubt.

606
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,618
I can't design without doubt.

607
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,883
My father said, "When you create,

608
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,053
you must always feel
a little bit uncomfortable.

609
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,016
And if you're feeling uncomfortable...

610
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,435
and alone,

611
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,937
you know you're doing something right."

612
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,906
That stayed with me.

613
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,746
I can't tell you, in the beginning,
how much criticism

614
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,291
and how much mocking, even,
we had to sustain to...

615
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,001
to be where we are.

616
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,962
Why is this practical?
Why is this useful?

617
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,630
Why does it deserve funding?

618
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,300
Why is design worth it?
Why is art worth it?

619
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:10,890
I know that from the outside,
it looks so precious and so elegant,

620
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,850
and it's none of these things.

621
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,437
It's dirty, and it's hard, and it's messy,

622
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,691
and it takes a whole lot of confidence
to push against the grain.

623
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,947
It's always very quiet
inside the eye of the storm.

624
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,954
But along with the loneliness,
there's also serenity.

625
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:48,177
And one of my big goals
is to protect the group

626
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,263
and to keep them inside
the eye of the storm.

627
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,191
The issue is that it...
it often does not adhere to the pectin,

628
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,442
so it'll... it'll peel away.

629
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,153
And you can see that,
in some of the pieces that are on my desk,

630
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,572
there are areas
that just tear away eventually.

631
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,366
Yeah.

632
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,076
Right now,
this feels like a pattern.

633
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,619
Yeah. This is perfect, though.

634
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,372
- This is so perfect. Yeah.
- This is what we need to shoot for.

635
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,957
That's very, very cool.

636
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,836
I'm excited. I'm so, so excited.

637
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:26,173
We started Aguahoja around 2012

638
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,719
with samples that were as large
as a sand grain.

639
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,680
And we grew the platform

640
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,307
until we generated
this five-meter structure.

641
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:42,148
And now, we're moving
to an even more sophisticated expression

642
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,608
that enters the... the molecular scale.

643
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,365
I mean, I grew up
with this vision of nature

644
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,618
as the untouched mother.

645
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,202
But now,

646
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,746
it has become our...

647
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,539
our child.

648
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,127
And so, it is our job
and our responsibility

649
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,920
to mother the natural world.

650
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:14,388
It's interesting because the word "nature"
is to give birth.

651
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,850
I've been doing a lot of mothering, too.

652
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,020
The projects, the organisms,

653
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,022
the students, the team.

654
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,273
My...

655
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,108
family.

656
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,488
And now...

657
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:32,739
my belly.

658
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:34,992
I am pregnant.

659
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,629
I think
there's another several rounds

660
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,006
of metamorphosis that she'll go through.

661
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,968
She's doing her own work, and showing it,
and getting it out into the world.

662
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,732
I think she'll start to get
a lot of people

663
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,883
who can bring her sensibility
into their disciplines.

664
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,891
There's much more to come.

665
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,020
I think in 20 years,

666
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:07,441
we'll be doing things, or wearing things,
or using things

667
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:11,779
that have affected our lives
because of that thinking.

668
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,573
That we will see the tangible payoff.

669
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,453
I love showing this is possible.

670
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:28,587
Imagine someone
with an early training in medicine,

671
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,174
with a passion for architecture,

672
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,553
who brings together the world of design...

673
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,721
and the world of nature

674
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,933
to international acclaim.

675
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,353
Imagine a leader

676
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:48,774
in education and research in MIT,

677
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:53,487
who inspires future generations
still to come.

678
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:58,659
Imagine somebody
whose style and professionalism

679
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,661
is a role model.

680
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,706
All of those qualities,

681
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,583
and more between,

682
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,293
is Neri Oxman.

683
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,215
The famous Einstein saying,
which I love,

684
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,426
"There are two ways to live your life.

685
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:19,638
One as if nothing is a miracle.

686
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,476
And the other
is as if everything is a miracle."

687
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,564
And that's who I am.
