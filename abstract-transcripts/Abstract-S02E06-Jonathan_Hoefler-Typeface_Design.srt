00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,432
[Jonathan] <i>New York
is a wonderful place to walk around</i>

2
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,435
<i>and see how letters exist
in the environment.</i>

3
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,396
<i>I think, as a typeface designer,</i>

4
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,773
<i>you can't help but look
at the typography of everything.</i>

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,528
<i>One of the really fun things
about typeface design</i>

6
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,739
<i>is nothing is out of bounds.</i>

7
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,783
<i>You can love rare manuscripts.</i>

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,080
<i>You can love graffiti. You can love logos
done by Madison Avenue design agencies.</i>

9
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,668
<i>Everything you've ever read
has been shaped by hand.</i>

10
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,922
<i>It's a profound thought
that every single letter you consume,</i>

11
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,633
<i>that there is somewhere a person,
or a team of people,</i>

12
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,968
<i>who have drawn this thing</i>

13
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,179
<i>and released it into the world.</i>

14
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,307
<i>We reach a point where everybody
has a favorite typeface.</i>

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,061
<i>The fact that you can choose the font
on your phone or your computer</i>

16
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,189
<i>has really sensitized everyone
to what typography can do.</i>

17
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:08,443
<i>We're making raw materials
that are open to interpretation.</i>

18
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,780
<i>That's really what it is
that moves visual culture forward. </i>

19
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,298
[woman] <i>Jonathan was this wunderkind.</i>

20
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,259
<i>You know, he had such an amazing way
of thinking about type. </i>

21
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,429
[woman 2] <i>He started young
and almost instantly became</i>

22
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,890
<i>one of the most
influential designers of our time.</i>

23
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:43,353
[man] <i>It's rare when you meet someone with
such relentless desire for perfection. </i>

24
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,397
<i>He has a complete awareness
of time and place. </i>

25
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,151
[woman 3] <i>Jonathan's right up there
with the best of the best.</i>

26
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,986
<i>He is the best of the best. </i>

27
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,202
[Jonathan] Typography is a dialogue

28
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,871
between typeface designers
who create alphabets

29
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,873
and graphic designers who use them.

30
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,458
And it's a two-way street.

31
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,504
The Public Theater behind us
has an identity designed by Paula Scher,

32
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,339
who was in season one of <i>Abstract.</i>

33
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,509
I grew up at a time
when Paula's work was everywhere.

34
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,095
And I grew up, therefore,
with a sense that wood type

35
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,097
was part of the fabric of typography.

36
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,683
In the early '90s, I began

37
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,394
creating a typeface family of my own
called Knockout.

38
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,564
It's meant to be inspired
by these kinds of wood types.

39
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,899
So, it was really kind of a delight that

40
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,443
Paula, when she designed the identity
for the Public Theater,

41
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,154
used Knockout for the design.

42
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,240
So, it's really this
sort of wonderful synergy of...

43
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,784
being inspired by graphic designers,

44
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,495
creating typefaces
that get used by graphic designers,

45
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,123
and seeing the way they do things
that are unexpected.

46
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,001
<i>Typefaces are a raw material. </i>

47
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,461
<i>To be a typeface designer is like</i>

48
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,047
<i>being the designer of a color of paint.</i>

49
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,925
<i>We're not painting houses,
we're not decorating houses,</i>

50
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,385
<i>we're supplying the color. </i>

51
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,639
<i>♪ These are letters ♪</i>

52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,353
<i>Typeface design is sleight of hand.</i>

53
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:11,482
<i>Even a simple goal, like make all
the letters the same size, isn't easy.</i>

54
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,485
<i>To make the letters C and T
appear the same height,</i>

55
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,363
<i>the C has to be drawn
so that it's actually taller.</i>

56
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,282
<i>Round letters exceed flat ones</i>

57
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,951
<i>by an amount the type designer
has called overshoot.</i>

58
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,123
<i>Another goal of typeface design
is balance.</i>

59
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:31,044
<i>To make a letter like B feel as if its top
and bottom halves match,</i>

60
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,795
<i>they often need to be drawn differently.</i>

61
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,716
<i>Turn it over, and you'll see that
it's actually smaller above than below.</i>

62
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:42,138
<i>The humble letter T conceals
one of the alphabet's great paradoxes.</i>

63
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,350
<i>To make vertical and horizontal strokes
look equally thick,</i>

64
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,603
<i>the verticals are drawn much thicker
than the horizontals.</i>

65
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:52,440
<i>This is called anisotropic contrast,
and it affects all the letters,</i>

66
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,151
<i>none more so than the diabolical letter S.</i>

67
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,988
<i>An S that's balanced and centered
looks bizarre when turned around.</i>

68
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,157
<i>It's thinner at the top and bottom,</i>

69
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,993
<i>thicker in the middle,
and it leans slightly backwards.</i>

70
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,634
<i>Typeface design is a slow process.
It can take decades, sometimes.</i>

71
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:23,012
<i>There is no obvious route
from beginning to end,</i>

72
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,807
<i>and there's no guarantee
of getting to the end, either.</i>

73
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,768
<i>About ten years ago,</i>

74
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,479
<i>I had an idea that I'd buy a wristwatch.</i>

75
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,607
<i>As I began really looking critically
at watches,</i>

76
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,944
<i>I noticed that a watch
that's 40 years old or older</i>

77
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:41,197
<i>has a characteristic
kind of lettering on it</i>

78
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,032
<i>that's really quite beautiful.</i>

79
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,954
<i>I was thinking that there might be
something in this whole milieu</i>

80
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,290
<i>that could inspire a family of typefaces. </i>

81
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,293
This thing is great. This is like a...

82
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,921
heavy metal sans-serif
with these sort of hexagonal,

83
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,841
bone-shaped figures
that are just fantastic.

84
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,844
But I really love these kinds of things
that are so much simpler.

85
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,222
I mean, this is a very boxy,
almost octagonal

86
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,558
form of lettering and numbering.

87
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,184
And you see the same kind of thing here,

88
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,478
but a little more sophistication
in this one.

89
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,107
<i>Michael Bierut once described what I do.</i>

90
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,111
<i>He compared it to the archaeologist
who finds a bone,</i>

91
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,572
<i>and from the bone,
like, creates the entire dinosaur.</i>

92
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,742
<i>A lot of what I do is finding those bones</i>

93
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,953
<i>and trying to imagine
what kind of creature they came from.</i>

94
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,539
[ticking]

95
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,923
Type design is different now
than when I started doing this.

96
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,925
To be a type designer was to be a freak.

97
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,764
I always dreaded
the conversation on an airline

98
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,016
with my seat mate saying,
"What do you do for a living?"

99
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,185
People would think
I designed the magazine itself

100
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:55,146
or I wrote the magazine,
or I, you know, made the ads or something.

101
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,316
And I'd say, "No, I design the alphabet
being used for the text you're reading."

102
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,777
And it was the incredulity of like,
"What do you mean?

103
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,571
That's like designing oxygen.
No... No one designs that."

104
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,408
That gave way to a period
of greater understanding,

105
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,994
as digital tools made fonts

106
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,913
something palpable to people.

107
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,375
Grade schoolers choose a font to write
a term paper in. You can't not choose.

108
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,754
But now we've entered this third phase
where people have favorite fonts.

109
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,090
Now when I'm asked what I do,
I say, "I design typefaces,"

110
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,633
and people say, "I love typefaces!

111
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,802
Do you guys know
the guy that made Papyrus?"

112
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,803
Or whatever it is.

113
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,849
It's funny going through life
as somebody who is attentive to type.

114
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,023
There was this fantastic
<i>Saturday Night Live </i>sketch

115
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,734
in which Ryan Gosling is driven crazy
by this ubiquitous typeface.

116
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,736
And what's so hilarious about it is

117
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,823
typeface designers who quietly suffered
with this all these years,

118
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,117
and to find that actual other people
do as well is this...

119
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,537
kind of hilarious and great moment
of kinship with the world.

120
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,497
Do you remember the <i>Avatar </i>logo?

121
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:58,418
I... Yeah. It was tribal yet futuristic.

122
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,877
Papyrus!

123
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,172
Good morning.

124
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,759
[Jonathan]
<i>Hoefler and Company is a 16-person studio.</i>

<i>We are best known to the world
through our website,</i>

126
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,848
<i>typography.com.</i>

127
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,684
<i>That is really the repository
for all the things we do here.</i>

128
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,728
<i>We have more than 1,500 styles.</i>

129
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,524
<i>We may have the goal of releasing
three typefaces this year,</i>

130
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,026
<i>but we're probably working
on nine or ten right now.</i>

131
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,944
Good morning.

132
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,838
[Jonathan] <i>One of the hardest things
about a typeface is finding a name for it.</i>

133
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,298
<i>We've settled on Decimal.</i>

134
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,342
<i>Decimal watches
are watches that the number of seconds</i>

135
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,137
<i>is divided not into 60,
but into one-hundredths.</i>

136
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,307
<i>The 12-hour, 60-minute,
60-seconds system,</i>

137
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,267
<i>and the scientific system of base ten.</i>

138
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,686
<i>Something about this
is very intriguing to me,</i>

139
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,606
<i>these ideas of two different systems
crashing together.</i>

140
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,858
<i>So, I think Decimal's it.</i>

141
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,362
Oh, there's a V.

142
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,408
And this is interesting. It's got the E
with a crossbar that's dead center.

143
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,118
Then on the same watch,

144
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,829
it's got an E that is above center.

145
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,956
Pi symbol...

146
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,167
I've never seen on a watch before.

147
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:27,089
There's a great kind of signature moment
in almost every old watch dial

148
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,591
in the design of the number four.

149
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,843
It's got that wonderful flat top to it.

150
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,223
This is a detail not seen
in, really, any typeface I can think of.

151
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,142
Here's another watch.

152
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,353
A different manufacturer,
different period,

153
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,146
but that same detail.

154
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:47,985
I started wondering why this one character
has been kind of fetishized in this way.

155
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,031
The best I can guess
is that in working at small sizes,

156
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:56,035
a designer does everything to get
as much air into a character as possible.

157
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,830
So, maybe this can be
the theme of the typeface,

158
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,624
these opened up, squared areas.

159
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,753
I'll probably not find an entire alphabet,
but it's far deeper than that.

160
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,339
It is what the punctuation looks like,

161
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:11,467
what the lowercase might look like,
what an italic might look like.

162
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,094
I've never seen italics in watches.

163
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,471
Can you abstract from this a larger theme

164
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,807
about what a whole typeface
might look like?

165
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,350
It's a gamble.

166
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,270
This is my first time
looking at watchmakers' letters

167
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,856
and it's kind of a scary empty canvas
when it begins

168
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,734
without really any assurance
that it's going to work.

169
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,367
Humor is such a great way into design.

170
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,452
You know the fold-in, right?
In the back cover.

171
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,162
-You've seen how this works?
-[man] Yes.

172
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:44,166
The question is, "What remarkable trick
did you learn from this magazine?"

173
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,420
[chuckles]

174
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,922
The remarkable trick is...

175
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,092
making 90 cents disappear down the drain.

176
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,927
-[laughter]
-So stupid.

177
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,431
I loved <i>Mad </i>magazine growing up.

178
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,350
I've always been a lover of satire.

179
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,562
Not just because it was funny,
but because it used this whole...

180
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,273
sophisticated visual language
to tell the joke.

181
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,402
The cover about video games
with the little video game typeface.

182
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:15,114
The wacky book covers we'd like to see.

183
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,991
That was probably
my introduction to the idea

184
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,784
that type has a cultural dimension to it.

185
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,704
This was probably the first issue
of <i>Spy </i>I ever saw.

186
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,164
Uh, the Kennedy-bashing issue.

187
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:28,044
<i>Spy </i>was the first magazine I'd ever seen
where I'd become aware of the design.

188
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,339
Alex Isley was doing
these extraordinary things,

189
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,675
using unusual scales,
making them feel tongue in cheek.

190
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,887
It felt like the perfect marriage
of art editorial to me.

191
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,847
I just love things like this.

192
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,767
The story is told with an X-Acto knife
cutting through one line

193
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,435
of Alternate Gothic that's letter spaced.

194
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,478
That's incredible to me.

195
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,148
That was the turning point.
That was the way out of

196
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,568
type as a part of satire into type
as a part of communication.

197
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,030
Oh, I can't believe Donald Trump's
gonna be in this episode.

198
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,114
[laughs]

199
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,992
<i>I never went to college.</i>

200
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,578
<i>Typeface design wasn't something
you could study back then.</i>

201
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,206
<i>In 1989,</i>

202
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,334
<i>I made a little self-promotion piece
as a mailer.</i>

203
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,628
<i>I sent this out
with the very non-specific goal</i>

204
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,255
<i>of getting some kind of work
involving typography.</i>

205
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,423
<i>But the first call I got</i>

206
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,926
<i>was from the art director
of </i>Sports Illustrated, <i>Steve Hoffman,</i>

207
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:17,927
<i>and he asked...</i>

208
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,849
<i>And for me, it meant the chance to design
a typeface for this prestigious magazine.</i>

209
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,941
This was the first thing I did for them.
Just these headlines.

210
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,068
This little composition right here.

211
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,405
And we decided we would do
a full family of typefaces

212
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,157
that would work in smaller sizes,
each with its own width.

213
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,951
That was a typeface called Knockout.

214
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,121
Art directors could match
the length of a headline

215
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,957
to the measure of the space
and always have a typeface that fit.

216
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,460
And most crucially
for a type nerd like me

217
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,214
is you begin to see
truly tiny things like this.

218
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,886
What I love about a lot
of Jonathan's catalog of type

219
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,639
is that you're always coming from

220
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,768
a really beautiful,
brilliantly executed starting place.

221
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,524
In the early '90s, I was at <i>Rolling Stone,</i>
worked for Fred Woodward.

222
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,401
We were at sort of the beginning

223
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,195
of doing cool stuff
that was getting some acclaim.

224
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,824
And I was invited up
to the Hoefler Type Foundry.

225
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,909
So, we go upstairs and...

226
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,621
it's, like, "This is...
This is his apartment."

227
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:32,710
And steps going up to a loft bed
with type posters on the wall,

228
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:37,256
and he had, you know, he had a Mac,
and very few of us had a Mac then, and...

229
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,425
And again, I'm like...

230
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,011
"This is the Hoefler Type Foundry?

231
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,096
This is crazy!
This is Jonathan's bedroom!"

232
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,977
[Jonathan] The first typeface I designed
for <i>Rolling Stone </i>was called Ziggurat.

233
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,564
I was working with Gail
at a time when <i>Rolling Stone </i>were,

234
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,609
"We need to lose resources in the art
department because of the recession."

235
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:01,280
Gail and I hit upon the idea
of taking this typeface and...

236
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,741
essentially retooling it
in different styles.

237
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,161
The collection of typefaces,
which we called the Proteus Project,

238
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,537
and there are four of them.

239
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,875
So, switching from one typeface
to the next, from one cover to the next,

240
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,044
the idea is these are all interchangeable.

241
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,004
You can take one out, substitute the next

242
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,590
and nothing really reflows
in your page layout.

243
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,344
[Gail] They were so cool
and so easy to work with.

244
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,056
They represented a whole era
of the magazine.

245
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,308
He had this stuff down, as a kid,

246
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,685
that we were just beginning to figure out.

247
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,356
When you think about magazine design
in the last 20 years,

248
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,359
such a huge part of the way

249
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:42,112
American magazines are designed
are Jonathan's faces.

250
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,405
He's everywhere.

251
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,116
Come on, he was smart enough
to buy typography.com.

252
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,828
So, you know, that's Jonathan.

253
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,766
[Jonathan] One of my favorite details
in a typeface are these things,

254
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,352
they're called manicules
or fists or indices,

255
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,062
hands pointing in different directions.

256
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:19,233
Manicules are just a way of attracting
the eye to a particular detail on a page.

257
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,443
It's been in printing
since the first books.

258
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,114
Something like this. That'll work.

259
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,951
-[man] Not bad.
-Yeah, it's a start. We'll see.

260
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,666
There's really no substitute
for working with primary sources.

261
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,836
These are type specimen books.

262
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,923
Type specimen books are catalogs
made by type founders.

263
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,051
These are things produced
just to advertise the fonts.

264
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,346
While this book is from the 1870s,

265
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,725
there are typefaces in here
that go back 30, 40, 50 years.

266
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,311
Styles that go back hundreds of years,
in some cases.

267
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,022
And a lot of these things
had been lost to time.

268
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:02,067
Uh, not one typeface on these pages
is something you can buy today.

269
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,446
In many cases,
it's specimen books like these

270
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,949
that are the only historical record
of some of these typefaces.

271
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,079
In the early '90s,
I came across this thing,

272
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,748
which I just fell in love with.

273
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,960
It's a form of Black Letter,
which some people call Old English,

274
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,754
that looks like that.

275
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,718
Black Letter typefaces really fell
into disuse in the 18th century.

276
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,802
It's alien.

277
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,182
People don't recognize this letter
as an E anymore.

278
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,143
But in the early 19th century,

279
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,396
Black Letter comes back into being
just because it's eccentric.

280
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,524
We think of this thing as being a fossil,

281
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,611
but it's very much alive
in typography today.

282
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,696
And it's been co-opted in so many ways.

283
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,908
Heavy metal uses Black Letters everywhere.

284
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,578
But so does gangster rap.
You'll find it in prison tattoos,

285
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,288
Catholic church, satanism.

286
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,666
And there's this
sort of marvelous dualism,

287
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,710
this sort of set of binary oppositions
where the typeface can be used.

288
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,587
So I began thinking,

289
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,132
“What might we do with this idea,
but take it further?”

290
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,804
About 23 years ago,
I started working on this typeface,

291
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,264
which we're now calling Parliament.

292
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,600
Embryonic, but, uh, a start.

293
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,562
I started thinking, "Could we do
a set of manicules in this style?"

294
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,815
Spent a lot of time trying to figure out
how these things

295
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,317
might evolve into calligraphic forms.

296
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,031
This is the final version
of these, uh... these manicules.

297
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,288
Thank you.

298
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,086
<i>One thing about typeface design
is this constant feeling</i>

299
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,879
<i>of not wanting to repeat yourself,</i>

300
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,383
<i>to try to try something new every time.</i>

301
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,637
<i>Challenges, in many ways,
get more demanding as time goes on.</i>

302
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,348
<i>The more interesting, the more specific,</i>

303
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,143
<i>even the more esoteric
a typeface you try to create,</i>

304
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,895
<i>the more you have to figure out
from scratch each time. </i>

305
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,230
<i>It's a puzzle.</i>

306
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:16,493
About 20 years ago, I was commissioned
by the designer Abbott Miller

307
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,579
to contribute a typeface

308
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,206
to the rebranding of the Guggenheim
that he was doing.

309
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,877
We began with openness and roundness,
given the rotunda.

310
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:29,631
The idea of making something feel
a little bit more elevated and lofty.

311
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:34,553
It's always a challenge to try to relate
architecture to typography.

312
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,474
An obvious point of inspiration
was this lettering on the facade.

313
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,768
The nice thing that seemed to recommend it

314
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,228
for adaptation for a text face

315
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,733
was its stark geometry,
which, in some cases, is perfect.

316
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,028
This letter M has a beauty to it
that is marvelous.

317
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,448
But letters like E and H
have this raised crossbar

318
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,200
that makes them overly stylized.

319
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,870
These are details that are
overly distinctive, distracting.

320
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,706
Our hope was to take
some of these qualities

321
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,167
and dial them back a little bit.

322
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,587
And push the typeface from being
a decorative signage face

323
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,465
into a more conservative face
for text and headlines.

324
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,594
Small details helped.
Giving the typeface a small lowercase

325
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,846
made the capitals tower over it

326
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,224
and made the whole thing
feel a little bit more grand.

327
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,935
Those in different moods

328
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,522
really capture a lot of the qualities
of the physical space we're in.

329
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,360
When an institution like the Guggenheim
adopt a typeface,

330
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,195
the typeface gets used everywhere,

331
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,864
not just in print publications
and on the website,

332
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,616
but in places like store windows,

333
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,326
exhibition calendars,

334
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,953
facilities signage,

335
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,663
way-finding graphics,

336
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,958
floor plans, interactive applications...

337
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,835
and even the guest pass.

338
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,756
The test of that one for me

339
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,759
is looking overhead and seeing
the lettering of the name of the museum,

340
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,970
but then seeing the actual lettering
on the window.

341
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,722
If those things
present the same kind of feeling,

342
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,558
then the typeface is a success.

343
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,230
When you design a new typeface,

344
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,316
the first two characters you draw
are the capital H and the capital O.

345
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,819
The principal is that the H
is a straight character

346
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,696
with vertical stems and straight sides.

347
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,865
The O is a round character
with round sides.

348
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,284
And in theory, once you've drawn
these two characters,

349
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,412
you've got a basic sense of the flavor
of the typeface you're designing.

350
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,248
Unfortunately, it never seems to turn out
that the H and the O

351
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,001
are the characters that designers
first draw, because they're boring.

352
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,963
The drawings I've done up to this point

353
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:36,425
are essentially an inventory of things
that are interesting ideas.

354
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,721
Here's that flat-top four,
and some ideas about watches

355
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:44,600
that have the same flat-top detail
in letters like A and V and W.

356
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,977
And by extension,
what letters like K might do.

357
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,272
It's essential at this point
to begin working digitally,

358
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,817
where you're working with the same kinds
of outlines, character to character.

359
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,655
<i>I came to design through computers.</i>

360
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,699
<i>I was a computer kid growing up.</i>

361
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,577
<i>I was into video games
when they were much simpler things</i>

362
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,162
<i>and you could make one.</i>

363
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,623
<i>As part of the graphics for it,
I'd do letters.</i>

364
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,958
<i>Every character
had to be eight by eight pixels.</i>

365
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,587
<i>And the question is, how do you give
your </i>Dungeons and Dragons<i>-style game</i>

366
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,215
<i>and your space game different typography?</i>

367
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,050
<i>That's tough to figure out.</i>

368
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,723
I'm at the point with Decimal where
I've drawn a couple of key characters

369
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,185
that I feel are very watch-like
in a nice way,

370
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,270
a few more that are
a little bit more neutral

371
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,398
to help me figure out what the tenor
of the design is going to be,

372
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,692
and then some really challenging ones.

373
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,780
There's a form of S
that you see in watchmaking.

374
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,698
It has these gestures

375
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,368
that point very aggressively outward.

376
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,161
But I've also found this J

377
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,248
where the stroke at the bottom
points up into the character.

378
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,875
A lot of what you're doing
in typeface design is

379
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,878
finding these eccentric things
and trying to figure out

380
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,047
what center you can pull them toward.

381
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,342
Does the S want to become more J-like,
or the J more S-like?

382
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,677
Or is it okay as it is?

383
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,012
Even this S and A that I've drawn,

384
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,266
the worst part of this for me right now
is I don't like either one of them.

385
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,977
I feel like as a designer I wouldn't use
either of these typefaces.

386
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,980
So, where in this continuum...

387
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,565
is the idea of Decimal?

388
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,025
What feels like a watch?

389
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,279
All typefaces
are full of these inconsistencies

390
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,365
that are impossible to justify
through anything except optics.

391
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,034
And that really is a lot of where the art
comes into play.

392
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,457
<i>Type design is not about drawing letters.
It's about drawing systems of things.</i>

393
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,419
<i>There are the letters in the alphabet,
other cases,</i>

394
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,921
<i>caps, lowercase, small caps, swashes.</i>

395
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,340
<i>There's an italic, there's a bold,
there's a bold italic.</i>

396
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,050
<i>All of these have to be created.</i>

397
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,637
<i>Our design team begins with Sara Soskolne,
who is our senior designer.</i>

398
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,765
<i>Jordan Bell is a designer
with a strong interest in lettering.</i>

399
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,851
<i>Troy Leinster comes from graphic design,</i>

400
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,855
<i>and Colin Ford is a typeface designer
and Python programmer. </i>

401
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,609
These are just different things
from different watches.

402
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:03,363
That's a concordance of all the letters
and numbers I found.

403
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,408
-I like all the little... little serifs.
-[Sara] Awesome.

404
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,660
Well, that's gonna be
kind of a question,

405
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,370
which is,
Is this a serif or a sans-serif?

406
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,748
And I've got my... my heart
on it being a sans-serif.

407
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,082
-[Jordan] Yeah.
-Check that out.

408
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,461
-Yeah.
-[Jonathan] I think those are fantastic.

409
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,464
-Jonathan, there's our lowercase.
-Yeah. Let's just do that.

410
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,299
-[Jonathan] There you go.
-[laughter]

411
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,593
[Jonathan]
<i>When I begin working with the designers,</i>

412
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,679
<i>they begin asking questions about
where the design is going,</i>

413
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,890
<i>what motivates certain decisions.</i>

414
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,060
<i>And that makes me realize that a lot
of the things I've been thinking about</i>

415
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,228
<i>really haven't been articulated
in the right way yet.</i>

416
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,565
I think one of the key questions right now
is what the curves look like.

417
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,736
I was about to ask what you're thinking
about the relationship between those two.

418
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,280
-I think we need to pick a direction.
-Yeah.

419
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,324
[Sara] I guess it's also a question of...

420
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,202
[Jonathan] <i>There is a lot of chaos
in the early days of a typeface</i>

421
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,330
<i>in figuring out what's the signal
and what's the noise.</i>

422
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:57,167
<i>But I do find that working with a team
is the best way to resolve that.</i>

423
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,545
Any last words
before we jump off the cliff?

424
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,047
[laughter]

425
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:14,226
[Jordan] <i>It's difficult to find examples,
historically, of italics on watch faces.</i>

426
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,938
<i>Whenever I initially skew the Roman form,</i>

427
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,898
<i>it creates this distortion</i>

428
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:23,568
<i>and pulls a lot of weight into
this bottom left-hand quadrant</i>

429
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,904
<i>and, uh, pinches up here.</i>

430
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,031
<i>These terminals, they're very uneven.</i>

431
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,242
<i>It can be tedious, but it's a nice puzzle.</i>

432
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:35,831
[Colin] <i>Ultra is heavier than bold.
It's as black as you can get.</i>

433
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,584
<i>The urge is to add
a lot of weight everywhere, </i>

434
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,295
<i>but you need to pick and choose
where that weight goes. </i>

435
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,135
[Troy] I'll be trying to articulate
what the thin version will look like,

436
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,221
because there's not much weight there
to hide detail.

437
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,558
I'm trying to keep
the same proportion between

438
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,351
the bold and the thin.

439
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,603
It's a bit of, uh, trial and error.

440
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,358
[Sara] <i>Working with Jonathan is awesome.
He's very, very collaborative.</i>

441
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,070
<i>He'll make a prototype
and give it to other people to run with,</i>

442
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:11,700
<i>and be totally unprecious about
other people's role in that design.</i>

443
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,454
<i>He quickly handed me the medium weight
to help with the prototype.</i>

444
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,416
I find that you cannot look
at the shapes that you're making

445
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,794
without also being very careful
about how you space them.

446
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:23,920
It's a huge thing.

447

[Jonathan] <i>Most of the shapes
that type designers draw</i>

449
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,639
<i>are the ones that never get seen.</i>

450
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,476
<i>These complex forms are carefully crafted</i>

451
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,853
<i>in order to establish the fit
of a typeface.</i>

452
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,938
<i>These aren't the shapes
of letter forms themselves. </i>

453
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,107
<i>They're the invisible spaces between them.</i>

454
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,027
<i>A well-fitted design
has a consistent rhythm</i>

455
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,488
<i>and strikes a perfect balance
between the letters we see</i>

456
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,156
<i>and the void that contains them.</i>

457
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,368
<i>Even the most well-fitted letters
need some extra helping hands.</i>

458
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,287
<i>After the alphabet is drawn,</i>

459
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,998
<i>a typeface designer will bring
additional techniques to bear</i>

460
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,625
<i>to ensure that letters can lock together</i>

461
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,085
<i>into words and paragraphs
with an even texture. </i>

462
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,715
<i>The loose spacing of this H and O
can be fixed through kerning,</i>

463
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,052
<i>the individual adjustment of space
between a specific pair of letters.</i>

464
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,596
<i>But kerning is just the beginning.</i>

465
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,848
<i>To improve the rhythm of this F and L,</i>

466
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,685
<i>rather than kern the letters together,
a type designer can provide a ligature,</i>

467
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,188
<i>a specially drawn combination
of two or more letters</i>

468
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,149
<i>that's automatically substituted
whenever it improves readability. </i>

469
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,533
<i>It's often the case in a typeface</i>

470
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,618
<i>that you find yourself</i>

471
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,913
<i>forced to follow tributaries
in places you wouldn't expect. </i>

472
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,506
<i>A reason to be in a graveyard
like this one</i>

473
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:53,635
<i>is to see how the mannerisms of
Black Letter typefaces changed over time.</i>

474
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,683
<i>One of the challenges
with Parliament is...</i>

475
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,060
<i>how do you modernize
this truly ancient thing</i>

476
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,730
<i>in a way that's actually useful,
but also feels old?</i>

477
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,149
[shutter clicking]

478
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,736
<i>With typefaces that are rooted in history,</i>

479
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,072
<i>I always want to go beyond
what's been done. </i>

480
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,242
<i>The idea of finding some attractive fossil</i>

481
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,953
<i>and just reproducing it
doesn't feel very interesting. </i>

482
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,038
<i>Doesn't feel very original, either. </i>

483
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,165
This is great.

484
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,085
It's the same Black Letter style
on every surface of this thing.

485
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,089
Incredibly hard to read there,
a little bit easier here.

486
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,303
But when the light catches it
at the end,

487
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,430
ah, this is just spectacular.

488
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,643
The legibility of a lot
of these characters comes from the way

489
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,021
the sunlight strikes these letter forms.

490
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,987
A lot of the typefaces we've been
looking at for the Parliament project

491
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:58,992
are Black Letter typefaces
with these raised highlights.

492
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,412
It's very fun to have an actual
three-dimensional model to work with

493
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:06,583
and see how you can change
the overall construction of the character.

494
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,502
And I'm curious to see,
when we get to working on this digitally,

495
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,505
how we can, uh...  how we can achieve
the same kind of effect.

496
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:18,470
The effort involved in drawing
contours within contours within contours

497
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,930
is impossibly complicated.

498
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,059
So, something we've been doing
is developing a tool to help us do this

499
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,354
which, for the first time,
allows designers to control

500
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,606
more than one contour at the same time.

501
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,400
Working with this tool in this way,
that'll enable us

502
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,820
to not just make one or two varieties
of an element,

503
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,447
but up to five.

504
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:43,036
Programming has always been
an important part of what we do.

505
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,873
In 1991, I got a commission from Apple.

506
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,919
They were developing new technology
to imbue a font with intelligence,

507
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,714
to know how to insert special characters
in certain circumstances.

508
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,301
I had been designing a typeface myself
called Hoefler Text.

509
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,763
And I had been giving this typeface
a lot of automated features

510
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,140
like lots of ligatures
and swashes and things.

511
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,477
And Apple licensed it
for inclusion on the Macintosh.

512
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,231
And subsequently on every iPhone
and iPad ever made.

513
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,862
Today, the typefaces that we create
need to be designed

514
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,866
in often distinctively different ways
to succeed in different places.

515
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,411
A typeface designed for screens

516
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,831
needs to be imagined differently
with applications in mind,

517
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,999
imagining how it would work
on a smartphone,

518
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,626
how it would work on a watch.

519
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,879
There can be the typeface
originally designed for print

520
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,257
that is revisited with screens in mind.

521
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,884
They'll do things like
change proportions of letter forms,

522
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,805
take gestures that are prone to congestion
at small sizes and open them up.

523
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,099
They'll change the spacing of a typeface.

524
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:50,228
I think, as with all technologies,
it's given rise to new solutions,

525
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:54,190
but also opportunities
to do more sophisticated things.

526
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,780
<i>We've been working on Decimal
for a while now,</i>

527
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:04,200
<i>and I think we're at a fork in the road. </i>

528
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,662
-How's it going? Oh, good.
-Pretty good.

529
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,622
[Jonathan] <i>There are
two different ideas going on</i>

530
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,666
<i>in the lettering on watches
we're looking at.</i>

531
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,502
<i>That's something we've been working on
in the last couple of months. </i>

532
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,379
None of these feel right.

533
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,506
I mean, including what I gave you
to begin with, so...

534
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,632
It's a real question.

535
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,470
This is where I always get fearful
that this is actually a bum idea.

536
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,180
-[both laugh]
-We should abandon ship.

537
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,974
<i>In a lot of the watch lettering we'd seen,</i>

538
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,477
<i>there are some curved letters
that are very round. </i>

539
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,395
<i>An O is almost a perfect oval.</i>

540
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,732
<i>Some that are very square.
Like the U, occasionally at the bottom.</i>

541
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,319
<i>There's a tension there
between these things that's not desirable.</i>

542
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,404
<i>It's much more disruptive
than I would like. </i>

543
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,948
Here's what it looks like in text.

544
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,409
[Jonathan] <i>The thought that a typeface
might not work out,</i>

545
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,828
<i>there's definitely a cost of failure
attached to that.</i>

546
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,748
Would either that or this work?
I'm not sure.

547
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,502
<i>As somebody who has a team
of type designers working for him,</i>

548
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,629
<i>it's a monetary cost as well.</i>

549
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,176
When you hit a snag,
you've got a couple of options.

550
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,345
One is to just push through
with brute strength

551
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,180
and hope that it all
comes out in the wash.

552
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,932
That never really seems to work out.

553
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,266
The second is to abandon ship,

554
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,269
to just decide this idea
is not working out and to put it down.

555
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,105
The third option is to just kind of...

556
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,819
squeeze the brief a little bit harder
and see if you can add more things to it

557
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,696
that might make it more flexible,
more interesting.

558
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:29,828
I wanted to look at some other examples
of lettering from very small sizes.

559
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,247
Uh, watches, obviously,
are painted in small sizes,

560
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,915
but here at the New York Public Library,

561
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,626
the map room has a collection
of engraved lettering in small sizes

562
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,419
from centuries' worth of maps.

563
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,717
The question in a typeface is,
"Will it be square or will it be round?

564
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,803
How do you resolve
these different systems?"

565
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,225
-Thank you.
-[man] The height of...

566
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,227
19th-century map production
right there.

567
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,938
[Jonathan] This really is insane.

568
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,281
That is great.

569
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,709
I think this is gonna be
our answer in Decimal.

570
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:24,924
Some really nice examples of rounded
and then not so rounded lettering.

571
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,845
This is an interesting atlas

572
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:32,974
because you begin to see a different shape
of curves working into this.

573
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,351
There's a great moment over here
on the left side

574
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,020
where it says, "Great Barrington."

575
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,397
And the O has a squareness to it.

576
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,444
That's exciting to see here,
but then equally fun

577
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,070
in subsequent pages,

578
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,656
there are a pair of streets
in this one map,

579
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,158
Hubbard Street and Charles Street.

580
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,453
And Hubbard, the bottom of the U
has this very shallow curve,

581
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,331
but then Charles Street below it
has a very rounded C.

582
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,334
So, I feel like this designer
is struggling

583
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,045
with a lot of these same ideas
that can be resolved.

584
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,213
This is great. This is really...
It's interesting.

585
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,051
<i>So many of its letters
seem to be drawn to be compact.</i>

586
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,219
<i>They try to fill their space
as much as possible,</i>

587
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,388
<i>like inflating a balloon inside a box.</i>

588
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:17,143
<i>We can create forms that are curved
but squarish. </i>

589
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,729
<i>Now, we can redefine the brief
for Decimal</i>

590
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,814
<i>in terms of compactness.</i>

591
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,777
<i>We've finally reached the point
that there is a theme to this typeface.</i>

592
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,326
<i>♪ These are letters ♪</i>

593
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,373
<i>Our attempts to truly see
two-dimensional forms</i>

594
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,668
<i>are bedeviled by optical illusions
from our three-dimensional world.</i>

595
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,003
<i>Typeface designers compensate
for these illusions</i>

596
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,215
<i>by focusing not on the letter's
construction, but on its appearance.</i>

597
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,384
<i>And the simplest letters
can be the trickiest. </i>

598
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:53,262
<i>The letter X appears to be made
from two continuous lines that cross.</i>

599
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:57,058
<i>But to have the appearance of continuity,
the lighter stroke needs to be broken</i>

600
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,560
<i>in a phenomenon known as...</i>

601
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,773
<i>Disassembled,
type doesn't even look like type.</i>

602
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,901
<i>Complex shapes like these
can be rife with subtle adjustments </i>

603
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,195
<i>needed to provide the illusion
of continuity.</i>

604
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:13,324
<i>A small curve next to a larger one
is something you see a lot on a typeface.</i>

605
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,786
<i>But setting aside what we think we see
and measuring what's actually there,</i>

606
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,789
<i>we find that these small
and large curves are identical.</i>

607
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,875
<i>This is a crafty effect known as...</i>

608
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,544
<i>And it's hard at work in typography</i>

609
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,672
<i>anywhere you find a pair
of closely related nested shapes.</i>

610
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,383
<i>Context means everything in a typeface.</i>

611
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,511
<i>Whether to give a letter form
thick strokes and blunt corners</i>

612
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:37,890
<i>or delicate strokes and a sharp point
isn't only about style, it's about size.</i>

613
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,851
<i>These two letter forms are designed</i>

614
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,478
<i>to feel like expressions
of the same underlying idea,</i>

615
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,481
<i>but one is designed for small sizes
and the other for large ones,</i>

616
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,358
<i>a phenomenon type designers call...</i>

617
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:05,209
About 20 years ago, Tiffany and Company
commissioned me to draw their logo

618
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,295
and then to do a family of typefaces.

619
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,173
Both of these things were designed

620
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,341
to, in some way, come from
the tradition of engraving.

621
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,719
Obviously, an engraved
piece of jewelry is, a, uh...

622
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,554
mm, iconic Tiffany product.

623
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,931
The logo was an interesting challenge,
though,

624
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,517
in that it's meant
to seem consistent everywhere,

625
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,313
but behind the scenes, we design logos
in a variety of different forms.

626
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,941
The logo will be appearing
on a flexible hanging flag

627
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,860
or on a flat awning

628
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,613
or in three-dimensional relief in metal.

629
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,199
It means making compensations
in the letter forms,

630
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,117
so that each thing presents the same way.

631
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,662
This project began in 1999,

632
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,956
and in 2000, I got engaged.

633
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,751
And there was this strange moment

634
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:50,671
where I had just finished invoicing
my client for lettering

635
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,550
and went to pick up our wedding bands,

636
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:58,179
and, uh, there was an item on the receipt
for lettering.

637
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,682
And, of course,
it's the inscription inside our rings,

638
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,186
which includes the
Tiffany and Company logo in small sizes.

639
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,191
<i>Carleen and I began dating in 1999.</i>

640
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,738
<i>She joined the company a few years
after that and is now our CEO.</i>

641
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,992
<i>She spent years directing marketing here,
and now really directs the business.</i>

642
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,410
Dude!

643
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,958
[man] What's the benefits of being married
and working together?

644
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,334
[laughs]

645
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,086
I think... You know what's nice?

646
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,172
Neither one of us can ever

647
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,843
get annoyed with the other person
because they have so much work to do,

648
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,887
because you totally know
how much work they have to do.

649
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,682
I've driven Carleen nuts
for almost 20 years with...

650
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,684
a typeface that's launching in January,

651
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,145
then suddenly it's March,
and it's like, "It's almost done,"

652
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,606
and then it's June and it's like, "Okay,
now it's done, but I've got a new idea."

653
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,651
Um, you know I know I make you nuts
with that and that's...

654
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,194
-You do.
-...will always be that way.

655
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,112
-[laughs]
-Um...

656
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,657
But I think, I mean, we're definitely
both able to commit to doing the things

657
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,534
that we want to do the right way.

658
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,662
<i>Carleen handles the business,
and I handle the creative.</i>

659
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,206
<i>We both find those two things
to be inseparable. </i>

660
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,169
<i>Carleen had this idea that we needed
a sort of store window</i>

661
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,546
<i>where we can promote our typefaces.</i>

662
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,091
<i>So, we created this thing
called Discover Typography </i>

663
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:21,220
<i>where we can create themes
that are interactive. </i>

664
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,264
-We did--
-Well, there are 12.

665
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,016
-Yeah. There should be more.
-The...

666
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:25,933
They're hard to do.

667
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,187
[Jonathan] Wanderlust was based on
vintage luggage tickets.

668
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,522
Barrel Proof was based on

669
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,316
-whiskey ephemera.
-[Carleen] Yes!

670
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,694
[Jonathan] Redline is based
on things with numbers.

671
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,820
[Carleen] Menus.

672
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,573
Take a Number was numbers
you just run into.

673
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,325
-[Jonathan] That was a fun one.
-Matchbooks.

674
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,912
[Jonathan] Trail Mix, we thought about the
connection between camping and designing.

675
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,080
This is...

676
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:51,584
really a new way for us
in marketing typefaces.

677
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,716
<i>Parliament is done.</i>

678
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,719
<i>Now, we're executing
the eleventh-hour stuff.</i>

679
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,263
<i>I'll sit down with Brian Hennings,
our creative director,</i>

680
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,142
<i>and try to find ways
to present the typefaces</i>

681
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,977
<i>in ways that are compelling,</i>

682
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,813
that show off the best things
of what the fonts can do,

683
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,733
but also to help
create the kind of culture

684
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,986
that people will understand about
what a typeface is meant to connote.

685
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,364
Parliament is so eccentric.

686
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,824
What I'm looking forward to
is seeing where it gets used.

687
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,244
I've been working on Parliament
for 25 years.

688
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,455
And the final act of the typeface
will be seeing it used in the world

689
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,541
and seeing what other people think of it.

690
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,004
[cheering]

691
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,383
The dream has never died, it lives on.

692
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,760
[Jonathan] One of the treats
of being a typeface designer

693
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,845
is you don't know where
the work's going to wind up

694
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,391
and you can suddenly find yourself
confronting it in the public sphere.

695
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,602
Gotham is a great example of this.
It's something we designed

696
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,813
when Tobias Frere-Jones and I
were working together.

697
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,065
It's certainly one
of our best-known typefaces.

698
00:37:56,399 --> 00:38:00,528
In the late '90s, I came upon
the Port Authority Bus Terminal,

699
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,572
which has these marvelous letters
on the Eighth Avenue facade.

700
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:07,159
They looked like somebody's elemental idea
of just letters.

701
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:11,872
I wanted to do a typeface based on this
because it felt so iconic and so familiar.

702
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:17,795
I was the design director of the 2007-2008
Obama presidential campaign.

703
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,923
Gotham really did speak
of American values.

704
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,552
Having that boldness
and having that candor and that honesty

705
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,930
that you just see when you lay out
the letters C-H-A-N-G-E.

706
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,685
It always starts with
when you look at a letter form,

707
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,811
or you look at a word,

708
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:38,149
does it actually communicate
something deeper than the word itself?

709
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,819
Does it actually drive
some other meaning to you?

710
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,363
And, subconsciously,
I think all letter forms do.

711
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,490
It comes down to

712
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,243
what is the emotional quality
that we're trying to say with this word?

713
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,705
And I think that that's the opportunity
that we have with typography.

714
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,041
It's impossible for me
to say that... that...

715
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,795
uh, there is something about the typeface
that it was instrumental to the campaign.

716
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,173
But in the last House race,

717
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:06,302
69 different candidates used Gotham
on both sides of the aisle.

718
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:10,973
We're starting to see Gotham become
the typeface that politicians use

719
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,476
because it has a track record of success.

720
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,271
It's a thrill to realize
the thing you put all this effort into,

721
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,690
at least one other person in the world
also likes enough

722
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,108
to use them in something.

723
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,277
The cornerstone
for the new World Trade Center

724
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,654
was designed by Michael Gericke
at Pentagram,

725
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,656
set in Gotham.

726
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,576
Michael chose Gotham
because it's of the city.

727
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,203
It's a typeface that was

728
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:35,414
designed based upon lettering
here in New York.

729
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,250
This was an amazing moment
in my career.

730
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,544
It was very...

731
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,338
very moving, emotionally.

732
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:46,133
I mean, you can't be a New Yorker and not
have your own September 11th story.

733
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,345
To have this particular connection
to the rebuilding

734
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,972
was really quite something.

735
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,308
I think of all the places
I've seen Gotham used,

736
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,519
that's the most profound.

737
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,312
It's one of the things I think of first.

738
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,029
It's a strange feeling
to complete a typeface.

739
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,033
Decimal’s been evolving.

740
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,244
This is the G I had originally and...

741
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,122
So, we've been very slowly
making it squarer.

742
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,041
This is how the S began originally.

743
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,211
And it's gradually become squarer as well.

744
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,338
This the four where we began,

745
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,590
and this is the final version.

746
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,009
We finally reached a point that

747
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,096
the balance of the square and the round
doesn't take two different approaches,

748
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,890
but takes a single one
through the execution of its letter forms.

749
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,601
[Troy] It's lookin' good!

750
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,145
It is.

751
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,731
-It's great to see the range of weights.
-[Jonathan] Yeah.

752
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:46,819
I'm excited about Decimal.
It's come a long way from watch lettering.

753
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,530
You'd be hard-pressed to look
at an actual wristwatch

754
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,699
and see that Decimal came from this.

755
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,033
I like that...

756
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,579
I can't even describe it. It's almost like
these are engraved letters.

757
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,832
Like, the copperplate tradition
or something. And yet it's not stuffy.

758
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,126
<i>You'll be able to use the typeface</i>

759
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,087
<i>in a way that is
completely divorced from its origins,</i>

760
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,214
<i>which hopefully makes it versatile.</i>

761
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,049
<i>But I'm curious to see how it gets used.</i>

762
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,386
<i>Whether people sense in this
that it has a heritage behind it,</i>

763
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,096
<i>or whether it feels entirely new. </i>

764
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:19,059
I just... I gotta say, I love the way
these little spurs worked out in the thin.

765
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,436
So nice, Troy.

766
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,439
<i>It's obviously very rewarding</i>

767
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:29,069
<i>to see that the very small
and mysterious thing that we do</i>

768
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:33,491
<i>become such a part of the fabric
of communication and of the world.</i>

769
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,829
<i>One of the most rewarding things to me
is seeing the ways</i>

770
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:43,042
<i>that people use the work that I do
in ways I never expected.</i>

771
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,755
<i>The way they find new voices
of typography</i>

772
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,757
<i>that's pushing things forward.</i>

773
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,468
<i>It's changing how people speak
to each other.</i>

774
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,345
<i>It's an exciting thing to watch.</i>
