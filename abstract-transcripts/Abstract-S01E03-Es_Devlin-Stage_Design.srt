00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,633
[Es]<i> Over the last two decades of working,</i>

2
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:13,007
<i>one of the things I've discovered</i>
<i>is often things are made to fill voids.</i>

3
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,426
[light switch echoes]

4
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,979
[Es]<i> The impetus to fill that hole</i>
<i>with art, to me, is fundamental.</i>

5
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,152
[other-worldly music playing]

6
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,954
[Es]<i> My canvas tends to be</i>
<i>devoid of light.</i>

7
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:35,792
<i>You sort of do need to start</i>
<i>without light to find it.</i>

8
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,711
[other-worldly music continues]

9
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,529
[director] Here's my first question,
and I've been curious about this.

10
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,861
Do you pronounce your name
"Ezz" or "Ess"?

11
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:58,827
I pronounce my name "Ezz,"
because my name is short for Esmeralda.

12
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,210
Often it's perceived
as being a man's name,

13
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:07,748
so I do get reviews in Germany, which say,
"<i>Herr</i> Devlin's incredibly masculine work

14
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,666
would have benefited from reading
the feminine aspects of the text."

15
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,337
So, it's a useful,
neutral little name, actually, Es.

16
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:18,256
I find it quite handy.
It's serving me quite well as a name.

17
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:29,573
Every project starts exactly like this.

18
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,320
Blank piece of paper, blank table,
there's usually one other person there.

19
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,584
<i>Could be a director, or a playwright,</i>
<i>or the artist, if it's for a pop show.</i>

20
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,869
<i>And a conversation happens,</i>

21
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,792
<i>and I'd normally just start drawing</i>
<i>while we're talking.</i>

22
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:49,669
<i>So, if I were to be having a conversation</i>
<i>about my own practice,</i>

23
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,763
it would start with this one,

24
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,339
with a little drawing
of a pair of scissors on it.

25
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,136
'Cause you used to get those,
and you still do,

26
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,891
on the back of a cornflakes packet,

27
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:05,812
and it's an invitation to take
the piece of the cornflakes packet

28
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,814
and cut it and make an intervention in it

29
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,146
and change it
and turn it into something else.

30
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,112
Like that, that will do.

31
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,074
And then you hold it up to the light
and you go,

32
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,574
"Oh, there's light
just coming through that bit that I cut!"

33
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,371
So I like that one.

34
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,292
I often get asked by people,
"How did you start doing what you do?"

35
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,872
I often get asked by young,
like, 17-year-old people,

36
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,248
who don't know what to do.

37
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:33,844
And I always feel very empathetic
towards those 17-year-old people

38
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,172
who say, "I don't know what to do."

39
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,175
<i>I was no different to that,</i>
<i>I didn't know what to do at all.</i>

40
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,849
<i>But then I did a course in theater design</i>

41
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,640
<i>and I found myself in this room full</i>
<i>of people making model stuff.</i>

42
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,271
<i>I thought, "This is good,</i>
<i>these people are feral,</i>

43
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,313
<i>and they stay up all night making models,</i>
<i>I feel quite at home here."</i>

44
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,608
So, I did that.
I just made stuff for a year in this thing

45
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,323
and then at the end of it,
I won this prize.

46
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:03,242
<i>One of the first major shows</i>
<i>I was asked to do</i>

47
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,826
was the Harold Pinter play<i>, Betrayal.</i>

48
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:12,459
Big piece at the National Theatre
in London, so I threw everything at it.

49
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:19,428
<i>And it says it's set in a bedroom,</i>
<i>a living room, a hotel room in Venice,</i>

50
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:24,469
<i>and what I did is I overlaid</i>
<i>the ground plans of every scene</i>

51
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,096
<i>with projections.</i>

52
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:31,605
<i>And at that time, it was quite unusual</i>
<i>to use projection and film in theater.</i>

53
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,859
<i>There wasn't really</i>
<i>an infrastructure for it to work.</i>

54
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,700
And the point about that particular play
is it really doesn't need any of that.

55
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,030
It does not need it.
It's a very happy play in a white box

56
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,446
with a few white curtain changes
and furniture, it's happy that way.

57
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:51,326
But that was me, I was doing my thing
and Harold Pinter was very sweet about it.

58
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,956
'Cause he was quite excited
to see all this gadgetry,

59
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:59,094
and, as a joke, he, on the first night,
introduced me to Antonia Fraser,

60
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,684
his wife, Lady Antonia Fraser,

61
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,800
and said, "This is Es,
she wrote the play."

62
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,056
So that was sweet.

63
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,139
[futuristic music playing]

64
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:13,358
<i>The beginnings of my practice</i>
<i>were making small theater.</i>

65
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,525
<i>You know, literally, there's an audience</i>
<i>of 78 at the Bush Theatre,</i>

66
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,939
<i>which was where I first started working.</i>

67
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,867
[Bradwell]<i> The Bush Theatre</i>
<i>is about the size of a matchbox.</i>

68
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,159
What it was, was close-up magic.

69
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,334
We created worlds
in a very, very tiny space.

70
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,380
<i>How do you build a revolve</i>
<i>in a theater that seats 80 people?</i>

71
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,341
<i>How do you do projections,</i>
<i>television screens?</i>

72
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,051
<i>People were spending</i>
<i>a lot of money doing that.</i>

73
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,053
We were spending
about four quid doing it out of junk

74
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,426
and Es was working out how to do it,
every single step of the way.

75
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,175
She'd paint the set,
she'd make the stuff, she'd weld.

76
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,148
[Es]<i> I began to find what I wanted</i>
<i>to say quite quickly</i>

77
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,321
<i>and quite quickly,</i>

78
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,779
people who didn't like the kinds of things
I was doing stopped asking.

79
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:09,658
<i>My practice has been following</i>
<i>my own paths of inquiry.</i>

80
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:16,206
<i>And in order to practice,</i>
<i>I have found willing collaborators</i>

81
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:20,713
<i>who I've been able to align my paths</i>
<i>of inquiry with.</i>

82
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:28,178
<i>From pop stars like Beyonc√©,</i>
<i>through to Wagner operas.</i>

83
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,848
<i>The interesting thing about the process...</i>

84
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:39,686
<i>I've learned that I don't actually</i>
<i>make anything or know what to make,</i>

85
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:43,194
<i>until I know what the space is</i>
<i>that it's going to inhabit.</i>

86
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,030
<i>'Cause as soon as you have a frame,</i>

87
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,243
<i>of course the first thing you want to do</i>
<i>is start breaking out the edge of it.</i>

The Faith Healer<i> is a series of monologues</i>

89
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,415
<i>through rain, through sludge,</i>
<i>through bleakness.</i>

<i>The interstitial gaps</i>
<i>between each monologue</i>

91
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:11,176
<i>needed to evoke that itinerant bleakness.</i>

92
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:17,481
<i>The rain fulfilled that need,</i>
<i>but also fulfilled a more practical need:</i>

93
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,022
<i>we are in a theater</i>
<i>that does not have wings,</i>

94
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,476
<i>does not have a fly tower.</i>

95
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,526
<i>How do we change the scenery?</i>

96
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:30,453
<i>We are using our rain box</i>
<i>like a curtain, practically.</i>

97
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,239
<i>From the actors' point of view,</i>

98
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,408
<i>they enjoy the way that they are</i>
<i>revealed and concealed</i>

99
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,208
<i>at the beginning and the end</i>
<i>of each of their monologues.</i>

100
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:46,587
This is a theater which has a brick wall
right behind what you see there,

101
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,345
and the audience who come to this space
know that brick wall intimately,

102
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:54,928
they're used to being confronted
with shallow space.

103
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,902
<i>So to give them depth</i>
<i>and an element that is real.</i>

104
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:07,533
<i>You can feel the audience feeling</i>
<i>the emotional response that anybody has</i>

105
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,162
<i>towards lit rain in a small, dark room.</i>

106
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,408
<i>And I'm satisfied.</i>

107
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,958
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>I have no idea how the rain system works.</i>

108
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,170
<i>It just shows</i>
<i>that you can design nice things</i>

109
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,041
<i>without having a clue</i>
<i>how they fucking work.</i>

110
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:30,215
Es is somebody who absolutely
amazes me every time we work.

111
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,891
<i>I come back excited from meetings,</i>

112
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:38,311
because she's always coming up
with information I would've never known

113
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:42,193
or discovered by any other means.

114
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:46,032
<i>A new stimulus every time,</i>
<i>many in a meeting.</i>

115
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,859
[Es]<i> Normally, throughout the process</i>
<i>there will be a number of meetings.</i>

116
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,157
<i>There might be five or there might be 25.</i>

117
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,662
<i>And it might take a year</i>
<i>or three years or three months.</i>

118
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,368
<i>I will have my team make models.</i>

119
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,997
I will draw the kind of models
I think it's going to be,

120
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,424
and then when I come back,
we've got a whole bunch of options.

<i>Sometimes they're interesting.</i>
<i>Sometimes they're less interesting.</i>

122
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,465
<i>We have another meeting,</i>

123
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,590
we say, "We think it could be this,
it could be that..."

124
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,144
<i>So you need to turn up with everything.</i>

[upbeat music playing]

126
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,526
[Es] This is actually probably
the most recent, and it's a rejected idea.

127
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:34,816
He was drawn in Paris
in Karl Lagerfeld's studio,

128
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:39,198
while Kanye West and Kim Kardashian
were being photographed on a bed.

129
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:45,667
And I sat at the end of the bed
drawing ideas that Kanye was having

130
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:50,052
and one of them was a man
made out of LED,

131
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,761
<i>and this posture is the result</i>
<i>of many, many sketches.</i>

132
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,893
<i>Because at first, he looked too strong,</i>

133
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,850
<i>then he didn't look</i>
<i>sufficiently vulnerable.</i>

134
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,681
<i>so we got to a sketch that he loved</i>
<i>on that day</i>

135
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,978
and we made this model.

136
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:07,151
And then we took it to Los Angeles
and it was hated instantly,

137
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,692
so it came home in shame.

138
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,904
And it's hanging its head in shame

139
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,525
with a little parrot-headed man on it
to cheer it up.

140

145
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,676

You know what you could do?

151
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,200
You could put the gauze there
and then have just a torn out area.

152

So, I think that's quite elegant,
if you just stretch it.

153
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,173
Yeah, I think that
would look really smart.

<i>I immediately wanted to make</i>

00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,179
I'll tell you
what my mind's going through:

158
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,648
is whether it's interesting
to see the mess inside,

159
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,439
or whether you want to keep it mysterious,
you know. That's the--

160
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,400
That's the point.

161
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,110
-Ta-da!
-Okay.

162
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,114
[laughs] I love that, I'm going to come
around here more often. It's done!

163
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,868
<i>There's an element</i>
<i>of anxiety about it all.</i>

164
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,043
<i>There's an element of terror,</i>

165
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,500
because Kanye is not going to be there,
Beyonc√© is not going to be there.

166
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:53,133
I've got to make something
that is worth watching on its own,

167
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,668
which I haven't really made before,
so we'll see.

168
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,507
It might or might not be worth watching.

169
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:12,823
[doorbell rings]

170
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,694
<i>-</i>[intercom] <i>Hello?</i>
-[Es] Hello!

171
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:16,987
[door buzzes]

172
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,741
[Tim] <i>I would never have been seen dead</i>
<i>at a pop concert,</i>

173
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,794
and I'd never would have gone to one
but for Es.

174
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,410
Well, he can speak for himself.
I would've been to lots.

175
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,828
But I think it's the spectacle.

176
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,627
[Tim] <i>All those lights that come up,</i>
<i>people taking pictures</i>

177
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,381
<i>and the deafening noise and everything,</i>
<i>I've actually quite taken to it.</i>

178
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,296
This was a lovely Christmas present
Es gave us last year,

179
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:46,716
and it's offcuts from a big set she did
in Dresden, and it's<i> Der Freisch√ºtz.</i>

180
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,808
Another nice thing is we get to see
a lot of the stuff she does,

181
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,975
so we're camp followers.
We are roadies, really. We go around.

182
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,986
And it's wonderful, because all sorts
of places we'd never would've been.

183
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,280
[Angela] <i>By the way, my husband,</i>
<i>you may not know this...</i>

184
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,034
<i>Es's dad is a great crocheter.</i>

185
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,276
<i>-</i>[Tim]<i> That's my speciality--</i>
<i>-</i>[Angela]<i> He makes tea cozies--</i>

186
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,118
<i>-</i>[Tim] <i>I also made the table.</i>
<i>-</i>[Angela] <i>He made this table.</i>

187
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,543
-My husband made this table.
-This is out of scaffolding planks.

188
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,042
Yep. Old scaffolding boards.

189
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,714
I mean, 90% of the stuff in this house
is from junk shops

190
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,384
<i>and we just painted them or made them.</i>

191
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,302
[Tim] <i>Yeah.</i>

192
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,630
[Angela] <i>So I think Es has done</i>
<i>exactly the same thing,</i>

193
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,966
<i>but we never really thought she'd go</i>
<i>into anything connected with art.</i>

194
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,311
<i>Music was her thing.</i>

195
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,311
[Es]<i> My way of escaping or adventuring</i>
<i>away from the countryside</i>

196
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,524
<i>was through music.</i>

197
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,439
<i>'Cause I would go up to London</i>
<i>on the train, age 11, on my own,</i>

198
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,280
<i>and I had music lessons in London</i>
<i>at the Royal Academy,</i>

199
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,695
<i>and then when I finished my music lessons,</i>

200
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,874
<i>I would then have</i>
<i>the rest of the day in London,</i>

201
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,623
<i>rocking about with my travel card.</i>

202
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,325
[violin music playing]

203
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,960
[Es] <i>So music kind of was an entry point</i>
<i>into another tribe.</i>

204
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:04,972
<i>And I have always enjoyed, since then,</i>
<i>being amongst the tribe of musicians.</i>

205
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,390
I thought that bands, you see,

206
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,975
'cause I had been going out
with a record producer,

207
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,401
and we went to see lots of shows,

208
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,069
and I always thought they were
visually desperately boring.

209
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,108
Probably because I went to the wrong ones.
I didn't go to the fascinating ones.

210
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,283
But they looked like this.

211
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,531
People playing guitars here, guitars here,

212
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,074
you might have had keyboards here,

213
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:30,657
and then you sometimes had
a curtain or the band's name up here,

214
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,455
or, if you were really lucky,
you might have had some projection.

215
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,249
But that was pretty much
everything I saw in bands.

216
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,295
And I didn't like this shape,

217
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,716
'cause I thought it was
a humpbacked band shape.

218
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,509
I was used to looking at opera
and theater,

219
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,432
and I thought that was a mess.

220
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:51,721
And I didn't like these lights up here
that just did "ri-ra-ra-ra" lighty things.

221
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,428
I didn't like it.

222
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,558
So, the first time I did a rock show,

223
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,815
I said, "Why don't we put
them all in their own little box?"

224
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,109
You can go in here, Mr. Drummer.
You can go in here, Mr. Guitarist.

225
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,534
The singer can go in here...

226
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,235
[rock music playing]

227
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:14,914
[Es] I put a gauze on the front,
like this, which is a kind of netting,

228
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,537
and I put a mirror all over the sides.

229
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,415
A very cheap, crap mirror
'cause I didn't have much money.

230
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:25,258
<i>And my idea was to sort of deconstruct</i>
<i>the anatomy of this four-piece band.</i>

231
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,681
So you just saw the vocalist's mouth,
the drummer's nose,

232
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,772
the guitarist's eye
and the bass player's ear.

233
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,845
But, in my excitement,

234
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,016
I neglected to remember
that this was their farewell gig

235
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,356
and they would need to take a bow

236
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,992
and step out and be seen
by their adoring fans.

237
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,739
[applause]

238
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,821
<i>So, I just stapled this front gauze on</i>
<i>and also, once they're in,</i>

239
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:53,947
<i>I stapled the rear projection screen on,</i>
<i>so they actually couldn't get out.</i>

240
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,457
People tell me I should
watch a film called<i> Spinal Tap,</i>

241
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,461
but I've never seen it

242
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,422
and I don't intend to
at this point in my life,

243
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,342
because everyone says
my life is too similar to it.

244
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,301
So I'm never watching that film. Sorry.

245
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,934
And this is what Kanye saw

246
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,800
when he was in the middle
of sacking his set designer,

247
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,178
and my friend heard him
sacking his set designer

248
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,675
and said,
"Look at this. She's just done this."

249
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:20,018
And Kanye said, "Oh goody, goody!
I'll have one of those."

250
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,564
So that's how it all started.

251
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,436
[heavy bass playing]

252
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,985
[Es]<i> What can this artifice</i>

254
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:35,793

<i>initiate, or generate anything true?</i>

255
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:44,915
<i>I have been given the opportunity to spend</i>
<i>sometimes millions of an artist's money</i>

256

<i>on, effectively, a sculpture</i>
<i>that they have commissioned,</i>

257
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,764
<i>like Take That's giant man.</i>

258
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,851
<i>The question of "Why?" endures throughout.</i>

259
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,556
<i>Why did we want that slice of light</i>
<i>through the middle of Beyonc√©'s cube?</i>

<i>Why did we want that block of light</i>
<i>in the middle of the arena for U2's tour?</i>

262
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,155
<i>In fact the U2 show,</i>

263
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:14,579
the whole conversation we had
was a journey from a square to a circle.

264
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:20,161
<i>From the home, to the world,</i>
<i>and that stage ended up actually being</i>

265
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,668
<i>a journey from a square stage</i>
<i>to a circular stage.</i>

266
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:29,007
<i>What I tend to be most interested in</i>
<i>is the psychology of a space.</i>

267
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,300
<i>A lot of my work now</i>
<i>is about finding environments for music.</i>

268
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,943
<i>And there's a lot more freedom,</i>
<i>I would say,</i>

269
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,348
<i>because many lyrics are already poetry.</i>

270
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,937
<i>So I guess I'm designing for poetry</i>
<i>to happen in, more often than prose.</i>

271
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,914
<i>I really quite methodically go,</i>
<i>"Okay, let's listen to the lyrics,</i>

272
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,659
<i>let's write down the lyrics</i>
<i>that we respond to,</i>

273
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,621
<i>let's try and find a poetry,</i>
<i>let's try and find a story."</i>

274
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:03,923
<i>And each time an actor or a singer</i>
<i>sings or says a word...</i>

275
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,710
<i>‚ô™ Blossom's fallin' from a tree ‚ô™</i>

276
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,714
<i>that's another question:</i>

277
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,795
<i>what should be around them</i>
<i>while they're saying this?</i>

278
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,630
<i>What would support or counterpoint</i>
<i>what they're doing?</i>

279
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,178
So, it's really complex,
there are a lot of parts to it.

280
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,270
[futuristic music playing]

281
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,352
<i>In spaces where I make things,</i>

282
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:30,358
I can find light and scratch out light
and shape things to allow light in.

283
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,901
<i>Like the U2 show.</i>

284
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:39,486
<i>We found magic tricks</i>
<i>that work best to control light.</i>

285
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,616
<i>For example, a mirror.</i>

286
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,960
<i>The first time I used a piece of mirror</i>
<i>would've been </i>Macbeth<i>,</i>

287
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,218
<i>where we sliced a box in half with mirror</i>

288
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,430
<i>and we were able to see</i>
<i>one half of this table,</i>

289
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,100
<i>with and without the ghost of Banquo</i>
<i>as it revolved.</i>

290
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,931
<i>And it behaved as his psychological space,</i>

291
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:07,097
<i>as a metaphor for the tricks</i>
<i>that were being played on him.</i>

292
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,685
And then recently I used a mirror
on a piece called<i> The Nether,</i>

293
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:18,366
<i>which was about a world created digitally.</i>

294
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:22,909
<i>So I somehow needed to make the audience</i>
<i>not trust their environment.</i>

295
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,825
<i>So what was interesting is people</i>
<i>who came out of that play</i>

296
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:29,745
<i>described having seen a glass box,</i>
<i>but actually, there was no box.</i>

297
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,625
<i>There was nothing there,</i>

298
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:36,842
<i>it was just objects placed in space</i>
<i>with a mirror set quite far behind them,</i>

299
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,216
<i>so the audience's depth perception</i>
<i>was really messed about with</i>

300
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,014
<i>so they thought they were reading a box</i>

301
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,518
<i>and they were just reading objects</i>
<i>in relation to an invisible box.</i>

302
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:51,362
And I use mirror a lot in the fashion
shows I've been doing with Louis Vuitton.

303
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:56,954
<i>This is a new discovery</i>
<i>of a transparent, two-way mirror</i>

304
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,566
<i>that is mirror whenever</i>
<i>there is not light behind it.</i>

305
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,999
<i>So, if you put a piece of LED screen</i>
<i>behind a piece of two-way mirror,</i>

306
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,829
<i>then if you conjure a face</i>
<i>against black behind mirror,</i>

307
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:14,257
<i>then the mirror will reflect the room</i>
<i>everywhere except where the face is,</i>

308
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:19,548
<i>so you effectively see a suspended face</i>
<i>amidst a huge double sized room.</i>

309
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,222
I'm making more immersive pieces

310
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,885
that an audience can wander around
and find themselves in.

311
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,360
<i>Just recently, I was invited</i>
<i>to create anything I wanted</i>

312
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,900
<i>for this Chanel project.</i>

313
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,741
As long as it was about scent,
it could be anything.

314
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,456
<i>I came up with a mirrored maze,</i>

315
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,959
<i>and it seemed to me that</i>
<i>that was a good analog</i>

316
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:55,001
<i>for the frontal brain making</i>
<i>50,000 decisions a minute.</i>

317
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,510
<i>And then suddenly allow them</i>
<i>into a room where the floor falls away</i>

318
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,715
<i>and they plummet.</i>

319
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:08,484
<i>Then you'd be creating</i>
<i>a sculptural physical analog</i>

320
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:13,443
<i>for how it feels to be</i>
<i>plummeted back in time to a memory,</i>

321
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,942
<i>in the way that you do when you</i>
<i>suddenly smell your mother's perfume.</i>

322
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,488
[piano music playing]

323
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,512
[Es]<i> I used to come to this church</i>

324
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,301
<i>and the extraordinary thing</i>
<i>about this church</i>

325
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:47,135
<i>is it's a very small, little parish.</i>

326
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,148
<i>And yet, there are</i>
<i>11 stained glass windows here,</i>

327
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,559
<i>which were designed by Marc Chagall.</i>

328
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,318
<i>Which is an extraordinary thing, I think.</i>

329
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,490
[piano playing continues]

330
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,252
[Es] <i>A local member of the parish council,</i>

331
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:16,460
<i>his daughter died in a sailing accident</i>
<i>tragically in 1963.</i>

332
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,594
<i>She was 21.</i>

333
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:24,802
<i>In memory of her,</i>
<i>he commissioned these windows.</i>

334
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:29,345
When Chagall came here
and saw this window in situ,

335
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,981
he said, "Okay, I need to do
the whole church."

336
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:39,230
So over the next ten years, he created
the rest of the windows, one by one.

337
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,863
[piano playing continues]

338
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,330
<i>There was a big Chagall exhibition</i>
<i>in the early '80s,</i>

339
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:52,909
<i>and it would've been around that time</i>
<i>I would've seen all of Chagall's work...</i>

340
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,502
<i>and also joined it together</i>
<i>with seeing these windows.</i>

341
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:01,877
<i>So this feels like</i>
<i>paint turned into light.</i>

342
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,925
The intensity of that cobalt
and ultramarine and cyan,

343
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:10,181
all those different blues
that are going on together in that,

344
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:13,604
is something that I would've seen in paint
and then I would've come here

345
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:16,734
and realized what happens
when you pour light through it

346
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:20,022
and look at the refractions
that are coming off it on the wall there.

347
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,227
And the fact that this guy...
There's his name.

348
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,938
You know, he was here.

349
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,370
It reminds you that artists all have to
come from somewhere, however small.

350
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,365
[birdsong]

351
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:33,951
What strikes me about these windows is,
from the inside,

352
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,748
they are this glorious,

353
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:41,051
jewel-like emanating source
of colored light.

354
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,918
But look at them here, they're black.

355
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,875
It's waiting to be brought to life.

356
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,086
It's how I feel
at the beginning of a show,

357
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,717
before the lights come up
on a piece of scenery.

358
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:57,898
<i>The turning of the lights out</i>
<i>at the start of a performance</i>

359
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,608
<i>is a really special thing, isn't it?</i>

360
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,819
<i>When you sit with a group of people</i>
<i>in the dark.</i>

361
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,070
<i>'Cause it's not something</i>
<i>we habitually do.</i>

362
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,657
And I think that goes back
to earliest childhood,

363
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,449
the lights being turned out.

364
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,872
You know, if you think about sleepovers...

365
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:17,041
<i>A group of children awake in the dark,</i>
<i>being an entry point into something.</i>

366
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,002
<i>And I think that sort of</i>
<i>does get rerehearsed.</i>

367
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,709
There's 80,000 people
and the sun goes down.

368
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,382
That's the same as
what happened at Stonehenge,

369
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,006
before there were any Christians here,
but there were druids.

370
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,642
<i>Something happens at that point</i>
<i>in the show, because there's a change.</i>

371
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:42,442
They have all come to focus
their gaze on one person.

372
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,145
We don't need to say worship,

373
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:51,244
but all the energy of the room
is focused on that one little individual,

374
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:55,203
and that in itself is an extraordinary,
physiological event.

375
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,455
<i>Eighty thousand humans are all looking</i>
<i>at one other little human.</i>

376
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,749
[electricity crackles]

377
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:00,872
[crowd roaring]

378
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,884
[heavy bass plays]

379
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,680
[Es] <i>I worked with Beyonc√©</i>
<i>on the </i>Formation <i>tour,</i>

380
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,852
and we came up with a thing that's not
terribly dissimilar to this in some ways.

381
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:22,151
It's a cuboid, but it does open
with this slit, this aperture of light.

382
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:27,443
When she was a child,
she spoke to a TV preacher

383
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,736
and the preacher said to her,
"Put your hand on the TV,"

384
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,739
and she felt the sensation of prayer.

385
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,618
<i>I think it was the combination</i>
<i>in a child's mind of what a TV does</i>

386
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:45,415
<i>and what the language</i>
<i>and tone of prayer feels like.</i>

387
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:52,005
<i>And later she realized</i>
<i>this big revolving block of her</i>

388
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,012
<i>is another way of broadcasting</i>
<i>her and what she's saying.</i>

389
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:02,515
If you look at most concerts before 2003,

390
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,145
most of the photos were done by
professional photographers near the front

391
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,532
and you'll see a big god-like image
of the pop star

392
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,070
and a load of lights behind.

393
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,242
<i>And that's how the imagery was recorded</i>

394
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:16,992
and that's how most people who didn't go
would perceive the show.

395
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:21,035
So cut to cameras on phones...

396
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:27,631
<i>Suddenly that event is being recorded</i>
<i>from every angle</i>

397
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,842
<i>and therefore my work</i>
<i>is suddenly being seen from every angle</i>

398
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,803
<i>and being understood in a different way.</i>

399
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,053
<i>So it's a big shift.</i>

400
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:41,228
<i>The artists I'm working with are bombarded</i>
<i>with images of themselves and their show.</i>

401
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,728
<i>They know their show</i>
<i>like they never knew it.</i>

402
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:48,023
They're aware that how many people
will perceive this show

403
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,936
will be via those media,

404
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:54,025
so, to a degree, we're designing
to a square at the moment.

405
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:59,115
That will probably change. Instagram
might suddenly become a triangle.

406
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,038
<i>The more I practice</i>

407
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,632
<i>and the more I begin to be</i>
<i>more self-reflective in the practice,</i>

408
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,959
<i>which is happening now, really,</i>

409
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,554
<i>then I begin to ask: why do I need</i>
<i>to engage with these people?</i>

410
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,552
<i>What relevance is this work to me?</i>

411
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,135
<i>Why do I need to...</i>
<i>What can I bring to it?</i>

412
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,482
<i>It's interesting, isn't it,</i>

413
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,519
<i>because the word "show" suggests</i>
<i>that you're revealing something.</i>

414
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,726
<i>It doesn't suggest finding.</i>

415
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:35,318
What would be nice...

416
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,494
<i>And because I do what I do every day,</i>

417
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:42,413
<i>I have to make sure the showing of things</i>
<i>is in itself the seeking for things.</i>

418
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,041
-Make it a little bit more punchy.
-OK.

419
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,369
[Es] Yay! Oh yes!

420
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,250
<i>What would you have to show</i>

421
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,554
<i>if you hadn't been looking</i>
<i>and finding and seeking?</i>

422
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,458
This is going on a truck tomorrow night,
going to Belgium.

423
00:27:55,632 --> 00:28:00,802
<i>So I looked at some footage of babies</i>
<i>playing with those sorting boxes,</i>

424
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:05,178
<i>where you pick up a triangle,</i>
<i>you pick up a circle, you pick up a square</i>

425
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,187
<i>and you try to slot it through</i>
<i>different apertures in the box.</i>

426
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,976
<i>It's actually</i>
<i>extraordinary footage to watch,</i>

427
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,484
<i>because what's happening in their brain</i>
<i>is every time they discover something new,</i>

428
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,188
<i>they're getting a little dopamine rush,</i>

429
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,868
<i>which is why we're biologically selected</i>
<i>to be in love with new things.</i>

430
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,825
<i>This baby literally,</i>

431
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,830
<i>either when it does go through</i>
<i>or when it doesn't go through,</i>

432
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,423
<i>either of those instances</i>
<i>is a new sensation,</i>

433
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,998
<i>and it gets a little reward.</i>

434
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:33,748
<i>That baby is the equivalent of me here</i>

435
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:37,007
<i>or in a stadium with Beyonc√©,</i>
<i>whatever it is.</i>

436
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,430
<i>It's literally what's going on</i>
<i>in that little baby's brain,</i>

437
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,549
<i>loving that.</i>

438
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,429
<i>That's what this box is about, really.</i>

439
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:49,483
<i>I have been trying</i>
<i>to fit different projects</i>

440
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,271
<i>through different apertures</i>
<i>in my own little practice.</i>

441
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,186
<i>It's a little retrospective.</i>

442
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,447
<i>This is Rye, in East Sussex.</i>

443
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:05,702
<i>We moved here when I was six,</i>
<i>and we lived here till I was 13.</i>

444
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:11,457
<i>And it happens to have in its town center,</i>
<i>a model of this town.</i>

445
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,763
<i>The model tells stories,</i>
<i>which I was very captivated by.</i>

446
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,684
<i>A ghost story, or a fable,</i>

447
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:27,061
<i>or the story of a butcher</i>
<i>who killed a mayor.</i>

448
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:32,805
<i>My house is just there,</i>
<i>and the roof is actually a pair of roofs.</i>

449
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,900
And I used to climb out
and sit in the little V out on that roof

450
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,494
and look out over the town.

451
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:44,275
<i>I started to associate storytelling</i>
<i>with models.</i>

452
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:49,197
The systems and influences

453
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,368
of one's childhood are inescapable.

454
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,128
<i>There's something about this</i>
<i>that I'm absolutely drawn to,</i>

455
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,801
<i>and my mind mentally enters</i>
<i>all of its streets.</i>

456
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,130
But there is another part of me that does
sort of wonder what would happen

457
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,427
if you just picked them up
and smashed them apart.

458
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,558
<i>You know, what if you put in</i>
<i>something really subversive</i>

459
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,179
or poured some paint over it?

460
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,311
<i>My work is as much a reaction against this</i>

461
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,606
<i>as it is continuing to perpetuate</i>
<i>the influence of this.</i>

462
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:26,584
<i>You can perceive the systems of a city</i>

463
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,448
and the history of a city,
when you look down on it.

464
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:33,246
The roads that were built
on top of the other roads,

465
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,792
<i>the periods of time...</i>

466
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:40,633
<i>So how I often use model cities</i>
<i>is I don't put them on the floor,</i>

467
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:41,884
<i>I put them on the wall.</i>

468
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,759
<i>Which puts the audience on the ceiling,</i>
<i>which I find fun,</i>

469
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,095
and people do feel something
when they look down.

470
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,431
We feel something here, I think,

471
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,686
and if you can bring this feeling
into a black box theater, that's exciting.

472
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,858
<i>I play with scale.</i>

473
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:02,939
<i>Scale is one of my ingredients, I guess,</i>
<i>just literally practically in my studio.</i>

474
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,028
<i>I have people of all different heights.</i>

475
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:10,201
<i>And one of the things</i>
<i>that I enjoy in my practice</i>

476
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:15,455
<i>is to position a human, huge or tiny,</i>
<i>in relation to the same object.</i>

477
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,714
<i>Recently, on the Adele show,</i>

478
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,587
<i>her makeup artist</i>
<i>became our scenic painter</i>

479
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,224
<i>because we knew that her eye</i>
<i>would be this big</i>

480
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,472
<i>and that bit of mascara</i>
<i>would interact with her hand here.</i>

481
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,810
<i>When I look over this particular city,</i>

482
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,864
<i>I play a little time-lapse</i>
<i>of my own journeys through it,</i>

483
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:42,399
<i>my own arrival on that train</i>
<i>when I was a kid,</i>

484
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:46,034
<i>the number of times I walked up and down</i>
<i>Tottenham Court Road,</i>

485
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,123
<i>when I worked in a bookshop there...</i>

486
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,413
<i>Perceiving the system,</i>
<i>finding the systems,</i>

487
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,543
<i>finding the patterns I guess, isn't it?</i>

488
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,290
It's much easier to find a pattern
if you're looking down on something.

489
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,590
<i>This is another pair of artists</i>
<i>that I collaborate with.</i>

490
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,587
<i>Kanye and Jay Z, for </i>Watch the Throne<i>.</i>

491
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,638
<i>Once we said, "Okay, 'Throne.'</i>

492
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,441
<i>What does 'Throne'</i>
<i>actually mean in this context?"</i>

493
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,476
<i>And really it's about,</i>

494
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,357
once you've found yourself
in the exalted position,

495
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,870
then the next thing
is the anxiety about losing that position.

496
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:36,413
<i>So they're at once</i>
<i>in positions of almighty power,</i>

497
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,206
<i>because they're 15 foot up.</i>

498
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,626
<i>But they're also vulnerable,</i>
<i>because they're standing up there</i>

499
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,960
<i>and they could easily be shot or fall off.</i>

500
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,837
<i>And they're alone, they kind of look</i>
<i>very lost and alone up there,</i>

501
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:52,345
<i>so it's a combination of power</i>
<i>and vulnerability again, I guess.</i>

502
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:00,850
<i>That tension between power and fallibility</i>

503
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,147
<i>is very fascinating territory.</i>

504
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,397
I'm not scared.

505
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,571
Just in case you're wondering.

506
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,864
[laughs]

507
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:12,775
I'm not scared.

508
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,754
[Warner] <i>Es, without any doubt</i>
<i>in my mind,</i>

509
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:21,168
is the most driven human being
I have ever met in my life.

510
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,919
You know, in fact, you know,
she is so driven,

511
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,422
I think her imagination
needs its own chauffeur.

512
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,927
<i>But it's not ambition in a normal sense;</i>

513
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,392
<i>it's really about</i>
<i>exploring the imagination.</i>

514
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:38,524
[chime music playing]

515
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:47,230
<i>And there is quality in Beethoven</i>
<i>and Wagner and Shakespeare and Pinter,</i>

516
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:50,567
<i>which perhaps there isn't in other fields.</i>

517
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,236
<i>And I've got a feeling</i>
<i>that deeply inside Es,</i>

518
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:57,664
the quality has got to win through.

519
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:05,535
This was made for<i> Don Giovanni,</i>
which is called the graveyard of designers

520
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:09,667
'cause it's a notoriously hard piece
to design for precisely that reason

521
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:15,386
<i>that it's very specific about people</i>
<i>getting stuck in corridors in the dark,</i>

522
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,930
<i>so if you don't provide the necessary</i>
<i>doors for all of that to go off,</i>

523
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:20,926
<i>it actually doesn't work.</i>

524
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,225
So, we made a revolving box.

525
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,152
It's a kind of maze.
All of these doors could slide.

526
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:32,323
All of this could be completely closed
or any bit of it could slide or open,

527
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:36,034
so it was like
an ever-changing architecture.

528
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:41,791
<i>It was projected on, on all sides,</i>
<i>with a mapping system.</i>

529
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,340
<i>When you make kinetic pieces of scenery,</i>
<i>it's very exciting to an audience.</i>

530
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:54,585
She always came up with things
that made me think about things anew.

531
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:58,136
And she talked about
the democracy of the theater.

532
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,521
<i>If you've got 20 people on stage,</i>

533
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,139
<i>you cannot control</i>
<i>where the audience looks.</i>

534
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,645
<i>The theater demands that democracy,</i>

535
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,649
<i>where you're making sure everybody</i>
<i>from the top of the house,</i>

536
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,402
<i>to the bottom of the house</i>
<i>is getting an experience.</i>

537
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,531
[Es]<i> The rook in Wagner's </i>Parsifal<i>.</i>

538
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,736
<i>What happens throughout the piece</i>
<i>is it turns</i>

539
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,825
<i>and you see it from every angle.</i>

540
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:27,172
<i>The reason we chose the rook was because</i>
<i>it's a symbol that everybody recognizes.</i>

541
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:32,257
<i>It's not necessary</i>
<i>for the audience to know every detail.</i>

542
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,719
<i>It's actually more helpful</i>
<i>to create an object</i>

543
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,840
<i>that, for everybody, has meaning.</i>

544
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:42,473
<i>For example, how you feel in a tunnel.</i>

545
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,807
<i>I think there are just</i>
<i>these absolutely basic, atavistic,</i>

546
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,654
<i>primal responses we all have</i>

547
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,189
<i>to being in a dark, curved tunnel space.</i>

548
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:57,485
<i>So I do think, on everybody,</i>
<i>there's an emotional response to that.</i>

549
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:02,237
But the things that I create
are not the things.

550
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:07,582
They are the time
that the people at the show spend

551
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,326
in the company of the things.

552
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,126
So it's time that you're making, really.

553
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,672
<i>Time perceived by an audience.</i>

554
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,127
[pulsating sounds playing]

555
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:22,346
<i>The objects themselves</i>
<i>are not what you think they are.</i>

556
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,983
<i>What I am trying to say is</i>
<i>if you were to keep the things I make</i>

557
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,229
<i>and put them in an art gallery,</i>

558
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,520
they wouldn't be behaving
as they were designed to behave.

559
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,228
They can only do that in time.

560
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,947
<i>Reflecting the light and projections</i>
<i>in different ways,</i>

561
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,408
<i>with different people inside them,</i>

562
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:41,198
<i>saying different words</i>
<i>with different sound effects.</i>

563
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:45,659
<i>With </i>Hamlet<i>, we made</i>
<i>a very specific timeline.</i>

564
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,251
<i>We read the pages of the script,</i>

565
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:53,672
<i>and we literally make a chart,</i>
<i>second by second, page by page.</i>

566
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,883
<i>What is happening? Who is saying what?</i>

567
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,013
<i>As I start to shade things in,</i>

568
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:02,262
<i>what I'm always thinking about</i>
<i>is how the audience will feel.</i>

569
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,814
<i>How long will they experience this for</i>
<i>and then what will happen next?</i>

570
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,562
<i>Everything else is sort of serving that.</i>

571
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,943
[Bradwell] <i>The design you see</i>
<i>is the tip of the iceberg.</i>

572
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:18,824
But the amount of work you do
to provide that tip of the iceberg

573
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,163
is what's important.

574
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,658
It will hold you up.

575
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:29,869
<i>When I was a child, what I'm doing</i>
<i>right now was my idea of utter heaven.</i>

576
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,126
<i>This was pretty much what I wanted to do.</i>

577
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,917
<i>But yeah, obviously now,</i>

578
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:41,974
the things I make are a little bit more
contemporary than a Pollock's toy theater.

579
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,551
But, you know, look,
you're already doing surrealism.

580
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,257
I'm just doing that, look,

581
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,427
or I'm doing this.

582
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:55,229
<i>With </i>Hamlet<i>, we made a very specific copy</i>
<i>of an Edwardian stately home,</i>

583
00:37:55,315 --> 00:38:00,065
<i>and it had to be that specific</i>
<i>and that real and naturalistic,</i>

584
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:07,043
<i>so that we could then violate it</i>
<i>with an influx of black poisonous earth.</i>

585
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:11,655
<i>So sometimes, as in the rules</i>
<i>of a surreal painting,</i>

586
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:14,495
surrealism works because there's reality.
