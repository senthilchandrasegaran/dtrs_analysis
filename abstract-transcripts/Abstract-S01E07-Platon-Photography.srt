00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,024
[Platon] <i>I'm not really</i>
<i>a photographer at all.</i>

2
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,818
<i>The camera is nothing more than a tool.</i>

3
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,780
<i>Communication,</i>

<i>shapes on a page.</i>

6
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:40,166
<i>What's important is the story,</i>

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,750
<i>the message, the feeling.</i>

8
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,212
[man in Greek] Sit here?

9
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,009
[Platon]<i> The connection.</i>

11
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,723
<i>How do you make this...</i>

12
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,765
[in Greek] Yes. There, there.

13
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,929
<i>reach people?</i>

14
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,307
[speaking encouragement in Greek]

15
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:09,031
<i>It's a combination of graphic simplicity</i>
<i>and the power of spirit and soul.</i>

16
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,374
[man in Greek]
You want angry, not happy.

17
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,996
[Platon] <i>It's design.</i>

18
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,869
[music playing]

19
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,689
[camera clicks and winds]

20
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,130
[Platon] Cory, can you
show me the fisherman?

21
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:56,974
Okay.

22
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,766
I think that looks pretty nice.

23
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,768
I know that Bob will be able to
bring so much texture out of the sea.

24
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,692
[Cory] Oh, yeah.

25
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,650
And there's loads of stuff in the island
you can't see, but we'll bring it out.

26
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,650
This is denim, which will be a gift to us
because of the texture.

27
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:19,567
-I hit it really hard.
-All the wood, Bob can bring all that out.

28
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:24,082
-Okay. Let's set up for the shoot.
-Cool.

29
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,168
[Pollack] <i>You can look</i>
<i>at a Platon portrait,</i>

30
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,216
<i>and you know it's by Platon.</i>

31
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,139
<i>He has photographed the most</i>
<i>important people in the world</i>

32
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,350
<i>from the last two decades.</i>

33
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:48,313
<i>A Platon portrait is about lighting,</i>
<i>it's about the person's eyes,</i>

34
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,475
it's about the graphic nature
of how he positions the camera.

35
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,815
<i>Sometimes it's from below,</i>
<i>sometimes it's straight on.</i>

36
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,992
<i>Sometimes it's really about the hands</i>

37
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,621
<i>and about getting an exaggerated look</i>
<i>from the person.</i>

38
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,740
<i>It is about getting the soul.</i>

39
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,617
[Lois] <i>Everybody he shoots</i>
<i>has a look in their eye...</i>

40
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,713
where you say, "Holy shit!"

41
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,546
<i>You're drawn to it,</i>
<i>and somehow he gets it all the time.</i>

42
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,640
<i>But I really think he's a mystical</i>
<i>and magical photographer.</i>

43
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,192
[Biondi] <i>Platon brought an enormous power</i>

44
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,270
into that square
or into that white background.

45
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,780
<i>The composition is graphic.</i>

46
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,157
<i>Once it's published,</i>
<i>you can't help but look at it.</i>

47
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,198
<i>And no one can intimidate him, you know,</i>

48
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,084
<i>Putin didn't intimidate him.</i>

49
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:53,590
<i>Platon has made this his own,</i>
<i>and it's bold, graphic and fearless.</i>

50
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,223
[Platon] <i>Before a shoot,</i>

51
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,588
<i>I'm not thinking,</i>
<i>"How can I get a good picture?"</i>

52
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,717
<i>but "What can I learn from this person?"</i>

53
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:06,716
<i>Every time.</i>

54
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,234
<i>The human condition is so complicated.</i>

55
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,324
<i>Questions like: what is good leadership?</i>

56
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,650
<i>How important is compassion?</i>

57
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,904
<i>Following your own moral compass.</i>

58
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,236
<i>How to cope with failure.</i>

59
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,161
<i>Questions that we all</i>

<i>To get to that point</i>

63
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,876
<i>you've got to earn it.</i>

64

<i>When a flower just opens to the light,</i>

65
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,846

66
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,349
-[Cory] Do you want more?
-[Platon] No, we should be good.

67
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,811
All right, thanks.

68
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,977
What book shall we give him?

69
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,982
-[assistant] I think <i>Service.</i>
<i>-</i>I think definitely <i>Service, </i>right?

70
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,775
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

71
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,106
Yeah.

72
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:05,908
We're good.

73
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,081
-It's perfect.
-[Cory] Okay.

<i>how conservative he's gonna be</i>

79
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,085
<i>You have to prepare yourself for that.</i>

80

[entrance buzzer]

81
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,516
[Biondi] <i>It is very unselfish, really.</i>

82
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,770
He's generally interested
in whoever is there in front of him,

83
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:41,225
and this does something, you know,
and people are willing to work with him.

84
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:45,243
Well, this has been
quite a journey to meet you.

85
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,452
Well,
I looked through your site last night.

86
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,493
-Right.
-Just incredible pictures. Remarkable.

87
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,498
-Well, incredible subjects.
-Yes.

88
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,170
I see. Hi, Bill.

89
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,078
[both laugh]

90
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,666
-George is behind.
-George? Over there?

91
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,001
And so is Barack.

92
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,012
I've got a present for you, my book.

93
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,509
Oh, thank you. Ooh!

94
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,681
[Platon]
And it's the whole military project.

95
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,354
<i>It's really a tribute to all the men</i>
<i>and women who serve their country.</i>

96
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,386
<i>And family members.</i>

97
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:18,396
<i>As I discovered through doing it.</i>
<i>I didn't really understand that.</i>

98
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,194
[Powell] <i>People don't know what it's like.</i>

99
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,565
By the time my son was ten years old,

100
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:29,784
I'd been away three years of his life,
two years in Vietnam and a year in Korea.

101
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,622
People don't realize
the toll it takes on a family--

102
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,202
-And a wife.
-And a wife.

103
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,754
[Platon]
<i>Taking a picture is very technical,</i>

104
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:43,173
<i>but 99.9% is spent on this connection</i>

105
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,304
<i>that allows me to reach someone.</i>

106
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,973
<i>And through that connection,</i>

107
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,931
<i>there's just a chance</i>
<i>you're going to feel something too.</i>

108
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,233
Right now, so, this is paper.
Don't lean on this.

109
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,978
-Got it.
-Have a seat.

110
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,820
So, uh, probably, more world leaders
have sat on this box

111
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,648
than any other chair on the planet.

112
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,743
Gaddafi sat on that box and Putin.

113
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,649
-So...
-[all laugh]

114
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,447
Not all bottoms are good bottoms.

115
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,124
<i>Having your portrait taken</i>
<i>is a collaboration,</i>

116
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,115
<i>or a dance, or a battle,</i>

117
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,214
<i>depending on how I'm feeling that day</i>

118
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,923
<i>and how my sitter's feeling.</i>

119
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,841
<i>Click.</i>

120
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,472
<i>With Chavez, I had 30 seconds</i>
<i>and I got one frame.</i>

121
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:34,506
<i>But he gave me his personality on a plate</i>
<i>and he knew it.</i>

122
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,346
<i>He got up. He turns 'round,</i>

123
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,564
<i>puts his fist in the air</i>
<i>like a power salute</i>

124
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,444
<i>and he shouts, "Platon!"</i>

125
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,021
<i>It was just the most</i>
<i>extraordinary moment!</i>

126
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:48,776
<i>There I am in front of Putin,</i>
<i>I'm asking him about The Beatles.</i>

127
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,525
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if I'm gonna get in trouble or not.</i>

128
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:57,696
<i>But with Putin, you have to go in close,</i>
<i>because no one gets close to Putin.</i>

129
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,705
<i>When I was doing Gaddafi,</i>

130
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:09,672
<i>I knew that this is going to be</i>
<i>a moment where the story is summed up.</i>

131
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:17,175
<i>I've never experienced</i>
<i>a chilling sense of menace and defiance.</i>

132
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,845
<i>He's not really posing for me.</i>

133
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,644
<i>He's posing for America.</i>

134
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:28,359
<i>My work is made</i>
<i>from lots of brief encounters</i>

135
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,323
<i>with extraordinary movers</i>
<i>and shakers of our time.</i>

136
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,704
[Pollack] <i>It could be</i>
<i>President of the United States</i>

137
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,414
<i>or it could be an undocumented migrant.</i>

138
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:43,372
<i>And he's always finding</i>
<i>a certain dignity to both</i>

139
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,628
and he's also finding
a certain power in both.

140
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,088
<i>He's getting that</i>
<i>often through the person's eyes.</i>

141
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,967
[Biondi]<i> He says something</i>
<i>that starts a conversation.</i>

142
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,473
While it is rather spontaneous,
he does his homework.

143
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,516
You know, how did he know
that Putin likes The Beatles?

144
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,728
This is unusual for me,

145
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:09,943
because often I'm working with a magazine
and that's the vehicle.

146
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,573
-This is just completely personal.
-Mmm-hmm.

147
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:16,994
It's not even a picture just of you
at this point in your life,

148
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,535
it's a picture about us.

149
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,616
[Lois] <i>It ain't just designing</i>
<i>a nice photograph.</i>

150
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,205
<i>He communicates</i>
<i>something deep inside somebody.</i>

151
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,039
That's his art.

152
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,918
You've been married how long?

153
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,338
Fifty-four years, 54 years in August.

154
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,798
Dude, you've gotta give me advice.

155
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,255
[laughs]

156
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,465
-Pass me the camera.
-Do what she tells you.

157
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,766
That's the best advice,
do what she--

158
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,180
My wife will love you for that.

159
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,808
-Play dumb, don't argue.
-Right.

160
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,154
I don't know about playing dumb,

161
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,769
I actually just have to be myself,
which is pretty dumb.

162
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:49,977
[both laugh]

163
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,856
All right, now this is how it works.

164
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,623
[Platon] <i>You may ask,</i>
<i>"What is a Platon picture?"</i>

165
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,624
<i>There's a path, there's a path</i>
<i>from the very beginning.</i>

166
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,867
<i>I was brought up in the Greek Islands,</i>

167
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,166
<i>and my mother is an art historian</i>

168
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,048
<i>and my father was an architect.</i>

169
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:18,094
<i>He would take me to beautiful buildings</i>
<i>and he would say, "Look at this building.</i>

170
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,268
<i>Look at the rhythm,</i>
<i>look at the fenestration,</i>

171
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,639
<i>look at the sense of human scale.</i>

172
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,104
<i>How does it relate to us?</i>

173
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,862
<i>And look at the majesty</i>
<i>of this giant beautiful thing</i>

174
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,902
<i>that someone created and designed."</i>

175
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:42,041
<i>My father used to do</i>
<i>these beautiful drawings in pen and ink.</i>

176
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:47,326
<i>And I grew up with this sort of</i>
<i>black and white aesthetic in my head.</i>

177
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,627
<i>It was so bold.</i>

178
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,590
<i>I spent most of my adult life</i>
<i>in the dark with a small red light on,</i>

179
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,045
<i>trying to find that visual language.</i>

180
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:05,805
If it's necessary, it's in there.
If it's not necessary, it's not there.

181
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,943
So strip it down, simplify it.

182
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,654
Just go... for the core.

183
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,110
<i>So I got used to looking</i>
<i>at something like the Acropolis</i>

184
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,735
<i>and thinking, "God, the power."</i>

185
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:23,239
<i>And many years later,</i>
<i>I found myself in front of Bill Clinton,</i>

186
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,326
<i>the first president I worked with.</i>

187
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,871
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>he's just a larger-than-life character.</i>

188
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,666
<i>You have to get</i>
<i>this giant monument of power.</i>

189
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,091
<i>It almost has the same feeling</i>
<i>as the Acropolis.</i>

190
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,630
[guitar music playing]

191
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,223
<i>There were churches everywhere in Greece.</i>

192
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,639
<i>In that church, you're going to have</i>

193
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:46,269
<i>a singular simple portrait</i>
<i>of a religious figure.</i>

194
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,648
<i>And it's just head and shoulders</i>
<i>and there's probably a halo.</i>

195
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,314
<i>That graphic simplicity</i>

196
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:56,728
taps in all my design ideas,
all the things I'm drawn to.

197
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,200
<i>A religious icon structure</i>
<i>mixed with modernist design.</i>

198
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,833
<i>Simple. Bold. Clear.</i>

199
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,999
<i>And you end up with a Platon picture.</i>

200
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,629
<i>So I grew up being educated as a designer.</i>

201
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,878
<i>I studied graphic design at art college.</i>

202
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:24,931
<i>My deep respect for form</i>
<i>and positive and negative space</i>

203
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:31,193
<i>comes from studying Frank Lloyd Wright's</i>
<i>idea of compression and expansion.</i>

204
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,813
<i>You walk into</i>
<i>a Frank Lloyd Wright building</i>

205
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:38,186
<i>and the entranceway is so small,</i>
<i>it makes you almost dip your head.</i>

206
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,948
<i>And then, as soon as you walk</i>
<i>into the main room,</i>

207
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,070
<i>he blows up the space</i>

208
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,827
<i>and it makes you feel...</i>

209
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:46,948
[inhales]

210
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,575
<i>"Aw, that's so good."</i>

211
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,252
<i>These are all lessons</i>
<i>I've put into my work.</i>

212
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,669
<i>If I can tap into someone's spirit,</i>

213
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,923
<i>it's the same feeling as when</i>
<i>you walk into a Frank Lloyd Wright room.</i>

214
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,177
<i>It opens you up. It does something.</i>

215
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,849
<i>And that's either a feeling</i>
<i>of complete menace or fear,</i>

216
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,101
<i>or feeling of inspiration and hope.</i>

217
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,975
<i>But it does do something to you,</i>
<i>as a person.</i>

218
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:21,778
<i>Another great designer</i>
<i>and incredible person through media</i>

219
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,201
<i>is George Lois.</i>

220
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,237
<i>He's the one that taught me</i>
<i>to be a cultural provocateur.</i>

221
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,749
<i>That's what I can do in society.</i>

222
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,368
<i>I can't solve any other problems,</i>
<i>but provoke.</i>

223
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,089
I consider him
one of the few people I know

224
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,708
who are cultural provocateurs.

225
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:44,594
<i>I think everything he photographs,</i>
<i>there's a chance for him to make a comment</i>

226
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,925
<i>about what the hell's going on</i>
<i>in the world, good or bad.</i>

227
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,851
And he deeply cares about the poor.
He cares about the...

228
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,225
[stammers]

229
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,810
He just cares about humanity.

230
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:05,150
[Platon]<i> All my heroes are people</i>
<i>who teach me about pushing buttons</i>

231
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:10,448
<i>and pushing myself to a point</i>
<i>where I can make you feel something.</i>

232
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:17,882
[Pollack] <i>Platon approaches</i>
<i>all of his pictures as an art director.</i>

233
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,711
<i>He embeds in his shoots</i>

234
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,756
<i>a sense of pacing,</i>
<i>how something's going to lay out.</i>

235
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,431
[Platon]<i> Because I'm trying</i>
<i>to simplify everything,</i>

236
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,390
<i>my pictures stand out</i>
<i>on the covers of magazines.</i>

237
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:34,931
<i>But it's really made out of my flaws.</i>

238
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,267
<i>That I can't cope with complication.</i>

239
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,769
<i>I'm extremely dyslexic.</i>

240
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,824
<i>I have trouble writing.</i>
<i>I write very slowly.</i>

241
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,032
<i>And reading for me is a huge problem.</i>

242
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,158
<i>For me, a very complex world has</i>
<i>to be simplified.</i>

243
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,577
<i>Has to be stripped down.</i>

244
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,919
<i>And design, for me,</i>
<i>was a way out of confusion.</i>

245
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:03,841
<i>Because great design simplifies</i>
<i>a very complicated world.</i>

246
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,469
<i>I still shoot with the same type of light.</i>

247
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,057
<i>The same film.</i>

248
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,523
<i>The same box.</i>

249
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,939
<i>The same shoot-through umbrella.</i>

250
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,898
<i>The same camera.</i>

251
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,190
<i>Everything is the same</i>
<i>and it allows the message to change.</i>

252
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,742
Now, I'm going structure you a bit,
so I want your shoulders dead on to me.

253
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,655
Okay? This is all that's in the frame
right now, all right? So that's...

254
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:42,705
<i>I begin with a long lens headshot, color.</i>

255
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,713
<i>That's always my first base.</i>

256
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,255
Don't move, that's beautiful.

257
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,969
Now, I want you to think...

[camera clicks and winds]

259
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,755
about what we talked about with sacrifice.

260
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,891
Stay there, stay there...

261
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,641
<i>And then suddenly,</i>
<i>I break through a tiny bit,</i>

262
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,484
<i>and instead of taking it and absorbing it,</i>

263
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:05,531
<i>I give it right back times a thousand,</i>
<i>and I normally yell at their face.</i>

264
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,237
[loudly] Amazing!

265
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,857
Well, let's go home then. What the...

266
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,816
No, we're warming up.
It just keeps getting better!

267
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,534
Right, stay with me.

268
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:19,537
<i>The shock of that destroys all walls</i>
<i>that they thought they were building.</i>

-Black and white.

Yep. Black background.

273
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,393
I want you to stay exactly where you are.

-Mm-hmm.
-Okay. Gabby will come in.

-You okay?
-[Powell] Yeah.

278
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,437

[Pollack] <i>He still shoots with film.</i>

288
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:23,556

<i>I wasn't just a foreigner.</i>
<i>I was a "bloody foreigner."</i>

<i>But after a while,</i>

320

<i>I now know what it is to hurt.</i>

That is a door to something

<i>I was doing pictures in London</i>
<i>that reacted against façade,</i>

<i>"Screw looking great and suave</i>

330
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,538
<i>I was shooting from the hip</i>

331
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,659
<i>in street magazines</i>
<i>that were coming out of London.</i>

332
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:54,037
<i>So one day,</i>
<i>I got a call from JFK Jr.'s office.</i>

333
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:59,258
<i>He saw all that work in </i>Face<i>, </i>Arena<i>, </i>i-D<i>,</i>

334
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:03,391
<i>and he said, "There's something</i>
<i>in your work that lacks polish.</i>

335
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,891
<i>This is the kind of work I want</i>
<i>in </i>George <i>magazine."</i>

336
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,393

<i>that's what I want.</i>

338
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,902
<i>Show me what it's like to meet them.</i>

339
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:18,573
<i>And it began me on a path,</i>
<i>which was incredible.</i>

340
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,372
<i>I thought that's gonna be my big break</i>
<i>in America.</i>

341

<i>without </i>George <i>magazine.</i>

343
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,377
<i>It gave me confidence to keep pushing.</i>

344
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:42,552
<i>I would be a fraud if I said</i>
<i>I wasn't ever dazzled by the lights.</i>

<i>You stop thinking straight.</i>

347
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:55,186
<i>And when John tragically died,</i>
<i>I thought, "It's all over."</i>

348
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,319

<i>Where I can express myself</i>
<i>in an authentic way.</i>

352

Sit where your father sat.

360

-Yes.

<i>I would always sit and draw in the square.</i>

363

<i>It was calm and slow.</i>

370

<i>That's a very powerful thing.</i>

372

[Platon] <i>The irony is</i>
<i>I went back to Greece</i>

00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:47,017
My first project for them

<i>Obama's first election.</i>

423

<i>And we wanted to do something that would</i>
<i>provoke respectful debate in America.</i>

424
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,042
<i>And I got embedded with the US Military</i>

425

[gentle piano music playing]

<i>We went to Arlington Cemetery</i>
<i>as one of the important sessions.</i>

429
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:28,020
And I noticed this lady takes a fold-out

<i>it means something to other people.</i>

Is it wrong to be
a Muslim in this country?

436

The answer is, "No, that's not America."

437
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,002
[Powell] <i>I feel strongly</i>
<i>about this particular point</i>

438
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,554
<i>because of a picture I saw in a magazine.</i>

439
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:55,798
<i>It was a photo-essay about troops</i>
<i>who were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.</i>

440
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,546
<i>And one picture was of a mother</i>
<i>in Arlington Cemetery.</i>

441
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,716
<i>She had her head</i>
<i>on the headstone of her son's grave,</i>

442
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:06,766
<i>and you could see his awards,</i>
<i>Purple Heart, Bronze Star.</i>

443
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,482
<i>He was 20 years old. He died in Iraq.</i>

444
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,153
<i>And then at the very top,</i>

445
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,821
<i>it had a crescent and a star</i>
<i>of the Islamic faith.</i>

446
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,529
<i>He was an American and he gave his life.</i>

447
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,028
<i>There was something I had wanted to say</i>

448
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:24,865
about the intolerance that is
being shown increasingly in 2008,

449
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,253
and frankly it has continued.

450
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,331
And so I said, "How can I really
illustrate and demonstrate this?"

451
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,997
And bam, there was the photo.

452
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,590
[Platon] <i>That was the beginning.</i>

453
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,223
<i>I realized that from now on,</i>

454
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,551
the hero is the person that inspires us

455
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:46,228
to think again about our own moral compass

456
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,595
and our own responsibility
as global citizens.

457
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:55,976
Platon talks truth to power in his work,

458
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,568
and he talks truth to power

459
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,743
in the subjects
that he chooses to shoot sometimes.

460
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,369
[Platon] <i>Human Rights Watch approached me</i>

461
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,751

<i>that's run by a brutal military regime.</i>

463
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,626
<i>No one's talking about it.</i>
<i>Can we do something about it?"</i>

464
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,549
<i>We published all the work,</i>

465
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,211
<i>and it blew up!</i>

466
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:22,217
That sort of aspect of pictures
can change the world.

467
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:26,845
<i>These stories will be placed</i>
<i>in publications</i>

468

<i>and that collectively brings a focus</i>
<i>on horrible situations</i>

469

<i>that exist in the world.</i>

470
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:40,029
[Platon] <i>I realized if I were to</i>
<i>raise my own money,</i>

471
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,492
<i>I could go to my friends</i>
<i>in the NGO community,</i>

472
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:46,912
<i>and I'll say, "Give me your stories</i>
<i>and I will bring them to life."</i>

473
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,919
[Pollack] <i>Platon came to me</i>
<i>with an incredible series of pictures</i>

<i>in families that were being torn apart,</i>

476

<i>and we were able to publish that work.</i>
<i>And not only did he photograph them,</i>

477
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,428
<i>but he interviewed them.</i>

478
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,637
<i>It was an incredible series.</i>

So here, there's something beautiful
about just focusing on the baby,

607

608
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,692
I think you need her.

You can tell she's in pain.
I mean look, there's a scar.

610

But I've also seen this shape
so many times.

But there's something
totally open about this.

00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:35,615
No one's performing.
She's just very open, very raw.

<i>The only way I can bring out</i>
