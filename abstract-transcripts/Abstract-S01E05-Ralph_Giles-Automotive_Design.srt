1
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,310
<i>I like to sketch the front
of the car first.</i>

2
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,390
<i>The eyes are very important to me.</i>

3
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,030
<i>A vehicle can have
a happy face, or a mask.</i>

4
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,570
<i>It has to impart a soul.</i>

5
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,620
<i>Why am I looking at this car?
It's looking back at me.</i>

6
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,080
<i>It stirs something in me.</i>

7
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,210
<i>People say, "I fell in love with my car.
It projects my personality so perfectly."</i>

8
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,720
<i>That connection with the vehicle,</i>

9
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,050
<i>it's extremely powerful.</i>

10
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,580
He knows I'll kick his ass, so...

11
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,370
It's a friendly rev.

12
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,250
He only has 485 horse.

13
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,250
I mean,
what are you gonna do with that?

14
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,550
<i>Everything should be art.</i>

15
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,986
<i>It's not just designing for Chrysler.
We're designing for car designers, right?</i>

16
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,800
<i>So we should up each other's game.</i>

17
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,180
It should look good.
It should sit on the road

18
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,940
and represent not only the brand well,
but be an attractive craft from Detroit.

19
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,660
<i>Ralph got a job as a designer,</i>

20
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,370
<i>and within a few years, this guy
is leading the design at Chrysler.</i>

21
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,210
I don't know of anybody, ever,
younger than Ralph

22
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,710
who's been Head of Global Design.

23
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,930
<i>Chrysler is a very, very scrappy,
innovative company.</i>

24
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,560
<i>It's always been the third largest,
you know, in the US auto industry.</i>

25
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,470
<i>And that's okay.</i>

26
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,940
<i>It's always had to innovate its way
to be noticed.</i>

27
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,950
<i>It takes a lot of work
to maintain a brand.</i>

28
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,200
<i>A lot of brands have died
in the last six years because of that.</i>

29
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,290
<i>The Chrysler brand
is better than it gets credit for.</i>

30
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,790
<i>Every brand, I don't care who it is,
has had a dodgy product in their past</i>

31
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,090
<i>that has sullied the brand
a little bit, unfortunately.</i>

32
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,840
<i>But I'm a romantic that way. I believe
you can design your way out.</i>

33
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,840
<i>You can create a product
that reinvigorates, revitalizes the brand,</i>

34
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,610
<i>and that's through engineering and design.</i>

35
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,720
<i>Right now, we're designing
the concept car, the SM-1.</i>

36
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,270
<i>It's a family vehicle that's
fully electric and autonomous capable.</i>

37
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,030
- Wow! It's really different.
- Yeah.

38
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,940
We really tried to play
with giving the car more stance,

39
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,740
make it feel slender and more Airstream.

40
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,070
It has an athletic...

41
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,240
Even though it's not meant to be
a sports car, it has an athletic stance.

42
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,410
I think that's what creates
a unique proportion as well, you know?

43
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,750
Do you think the horizon line
will actually behave that way?

44
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,210
Do you intend the line to be that crisp,
or are you gonna soften it off a little?

45
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,840
Are you counting on paint to do this,
or are you gonna make a crisp line?

46
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,930
Crisp line.

47
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,050
I think the initial idea
was to soften it up,

48
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,220
- not so soft that there's not a break...
- Yeah.

49
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,730
But soft enough that, you know,
all of these radiuses kind of...

50
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,210
- You mind if I put a piece of tape on it?
- Yeah, go for it.

51
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,650
See if it kind of holds
all the way around the car.

52
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,770
Test it out.

53
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,150
<i>Most designs have a theme line
that holds the design together.</i>

54
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,820
<i>The tape is one of those lines.</i>

55
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,990
<i>If you don't get the bones right,</i>

56
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,950
<i>you're never gonna have a good design,
no matter how hard you try.</i>

57
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,870
<i>I remember in school,
times we talked about,</i>

58
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,210
<i>"Can you sketch this car in three lines?"
You know?</i>

59
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,090
<i>"Is it distinctive enough to capture it?"
And I think you could.</i>

60
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,470
I hate to break it to you,
I'm not feeling the wheels.

61
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,670
Those are just placeholders?

62
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,010
Well... That's where we're headed.

63
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,190
- However, we have time to change...
- I've seen the wheels...

64
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,950
You know I hate directional wheels, right?
You understand this as...

65
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,320
- I know now.
- They're too much.

66
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,110
We can work on it, right?

67
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,400
No, I think it's a great design.
I'm really proud of you guys.

68
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,490
Good.

69
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,740
<i>If you ask someone at Ford or GM,
they could care less about Chrysler,</i>

70
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,000
<i>they think Chrysler
is already a dead brand.</i>

71
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,290
<i>So this concept car
is a huge investment for Chrysler.</i>

72
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,590
<i>We don't want to just build
a fanciful concept car.</i>

73
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,840
<i>That's easy to do.</i>

74
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,760
Wow, there's a lot of work here.

75
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,270
<i>This thing holds a lot of other
innovations that will be useful to us</i>

76
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,690
<i>in a myriad of vehicles.</i>

77
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,400
It still has a portal
that represents eyes.

78
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,360
It celebrates the brand beautifully,
but it's like nothing else out there.

79
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,530
<i>For the next few months, we're designing
everything your eye can see,</i>

80
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,910
<i>the safety items, the infotainment...</i>

81
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,290
<i>The design has to be so powerful
that it blows through all the paradigms</i>

82
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,920
<i>and stands for something.</i>

83
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,210
<i>We already own this minivan space,
but can we amplify it</i>

84
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,420
<i>and have it mean something
to a whole bunch of people?</i>

85
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,550
<i>Fleet companies, the whole autonomous car,</i>

86
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,550
<i>there's so many ways we can take this,
so it's pretty big.</i>

87
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,930
So the fate of the SM1 is riding on
a meeting we're having a month from now

88
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,310
with the CEO of the company.

89
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,150
If he likes it, it'll go to production,
perhaps, or at least as a concept car.

90
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,690
If he doesn't like it, the whole thing
will pretty much just be scrapped.

91
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,750
The real genius is Ralph is charged
with designing a vehicle

92
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,580
that millions of people
would want to buy, and like,

93
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,960
as opposed to
a couple of hundred wealthy people,

94
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,540
who want something outrageous.

95
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,010
<i>And when you talk to car designers,</i>

96
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,890
<i>you realize they're taking a styling cue
from something that was designed in 1938,</i>

97
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,220
<i>some obscure car,</i>

98
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,560
<i>but they remember that,
and they've integrated that into the...</i>

99
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,310
You need all the information to do it now.

100
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,350
Oh, look at this.

101
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,150
This is another gorgeous, gorgeous Ferrari
with these beautiful double-cockpit looks.

102
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,410
This vehicle only has one door,
and then there's no seam.

103
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,240
They really didn't want
to waste the weight of the hinges

104
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,500
or create any more aerodynamic drag,
so everything is seamless.

105
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,870
Now that's for future reference!

106
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,726
<i>One of the reasons I went to </i>Mille Miglia

107
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,670
<i>is to really dive into the most known race
in Italy,</i>

108
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,300
<i>the most known event of the country
and be in it, to get it, to feel it.</i>

109
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,140
<i>That inspires me.</i>

110
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,060
- How you doing, Larry?
- Good morning!

111
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,150
Morning, man!

112
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,320
So this is Carina. I named her Carina
because it means "sweet woman" in Italian.

113
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,570
She's a 1957 Super Sport Zagato...
Alfa Romeo, Zagato.

114
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,740
What's cool about this car
is it's called the double bubble roof.

115
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,620
If you can imagine, it didn't have that,

116
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,250
it would be a very tall,
unattractive-looking roof.

117
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,290
So designers had to figure out
a way to get the required clearance,

118
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,710
but keep the vehicle as low,

119
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,670
and punch the smallest hole
through the wind, as possible.

120
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,521
And it's funny 'cause, actually,
our current Viper, and a lot of cars,

121
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,260
have adopted this feature
in various forms.

122
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,340
It's special.

123
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,770
I mean, there's maybe a dozen
that have the double bubble, so...

124
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,690
No. No, imagine how ugly
it would look.

125
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,810
If you fill that in, it would be here.

126
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
It would look terrible.
So I think that's cool.

127
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,440
- Oh, I get it, so that was aesthetic.
- It's always about aesthetics.

128
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,450
It's awesome.

129
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,640
I have no idea what that car was,
but I'm going to find out.

130
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,660
That's the other thing that's hitting me.

131
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,000
<i>I was born in 1970, so many of these cars
are twice my age.</i>

132
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,340
<i>My love affair with cars came
from just walking around</i>

133
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,930
<i>and seeing how ugly cars were.</i>

134
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,050
<i>I grew up in Montreal, Quebec,
in the late '70s and early '80s.</i>

135
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,930
I remember thinking to myself, "Ugh."

136
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,020
<i>And then one day,
I saw a Porsche 911 Turbo.</i>

137
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,270
<i>I think I was maybe nine years old.</i>

138
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,400
And it struck me as being,

139
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,900
"Why is that car more attractive
than the one next to it?"

140
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,690
<i>And then I started noticing
more beautiful cars.</i>

141
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,620
<i>I would watch </i>Smokey and the Bandit,
<i>the Trans Am, even Tom Selleck.</i>

142
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,056
<i>I couldn't care less about Tom Selleck,
I'd watch the Ferrari.</i>

143
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,660
<i>And, of course, </i>Dukes of Hazzard<i>.</i>
<i>I used to watch it religiously.</i>

144
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,080
I had to negotiate with my parents
my homework time

145
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,210
and <i>Dukes of Hazzard </i>time.

146
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,880
<i>So that's who I am, really simply.</i>

147
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,300
<i>Someone who just woke up one day
and started noticing this machine.</i>

148
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,850
<i>So I'm the product
of proud Haitian immigrants, you know.</i>

149
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,350
<i>And my father had very high expectations
for me from the beginning.</i>

150
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,310
<i>Extremely critical. I mean,
we didn't even have time to play.</i>

151
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,836
<i>Part of the problem with my dad and I</i>

152
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,400
<i>was he wanted me to be an engineer.
I wanted to be an artist.</i>

153
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,730
And he didn't know what to do with me.

154
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,490
<i>So I just stayed in my room
and drew a lot.</i>

155
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,030
<i>My brother,
he started with stick figures of cars</i>

156
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,830
and then eventually, they became...
they actually started looking like cars.

157
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,420
<i>I think it was just
an innate gift that he had.</i>

158
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,670
Okay.

159
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,220
<i>But I guess the gnawing sensation
in the back of my mind was:</i>

160
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,300
<i>"I can't let Dad down.</i>

161
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,980
I'm not going to let him down.
I'll find a way to figure this out."

162
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,930
I call this my folder of innocence.

163
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,520
Wow, this is really old.
A Jeep Cherokee my dad had.

164
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,170
<i>Chrysler, their image,
it's not the greatest.</i>

165
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,920
They are the smallest
of the three automakers.

166
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,050
They don't have strong brand images
the way Toyota or Honda or BMW do,

167
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,600
<i>so they've really gotta fight
to get people to buy their cars,</i>

168
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,890
<i>and design has to be spot-on
for them to be successful.</i>

169
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,230
Hey, Ralph.

170
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,730
Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.

171
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,950
<i>In our company, we have 21 nameplates
just on this side of the pond,</i>

172
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,160
<i>and in Europe we have another 25 or so,</i>

173
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,240
<i>so we have a lot of different cars
and we have multiple brands.</i>

174
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,540
We've added some things.
You can actually swipe songs now.

175
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
I love that.

176
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,960
<i>There's something more
to this than just designing.</i>

177
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,050
<i>You have to manage talent,
'cause it takes an army.</i>

178
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,420
This is a little bit too fine. I think
that could use a little more beef.

179
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,510
This is nice.

180
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,010
<i>I always try and imagine the future.</i>

181
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,930
The feng shui piece of the screen
bothers me.

182
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,116
Like, the fact that the screen
will be there all the time.

183
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,770
Maybe it flips and then it adjusts?

184
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,980
- We can do that.
- It has to be all James Bond.

185
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,480
You're designing
for five years in the future,

186
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,070
then you have to think about the car
living in market three to six years.

187
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,070
<i>So you're looking at
a nine-year window of time</i>

188
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,240
<i>that you have to consider
when you're creating these vehicles,</i>

189
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,240
and that's...

190
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,330
It's daunting.

191
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,410
<i>Jeep is in good shape,
RAM is doing extremely well,</i>

192
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,370
<i>Dodge has found its way,</i>

193
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,000
<i>but Chrysler's the one that has
the least amount of new nameplates.</i>

194
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,130
<i>People must be wondering,
"What is Chrysler doing?</i>

195
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,010
<i>They only have three nameplates.
They used to have eight or nine."</i>

196
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,510
<i>So this concept car's important to say,
"Hey, we're investing in this brand,</i>

197
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,060
<i>but we're changing the direction
of what the brand means."</i>

198
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,560
<i>Last, but not least... All those
wanting to know your feelings on SM-1.</i>

199
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,020
A comment
on the fabrication side, Ralph.

200
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,730
The roof glass
is probably going to have to be acrylic.

201
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,780
I don't know exactly how to produce those,

202
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,700
they're probably going to have to be
poured, machine polished.

203
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,740
- Sounds expensive.
- Well, I don't know yet.

204
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,530
We have to be finished with the car
two to four weeks ahead of time

205
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,790
just to give the fabricator the time
to work out the bugs.

206
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,920
I trust you guys, but let me know
if you come to...

207
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You're going to come to multiple forks
in the road.

208
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,170
Just, you know,
I'd like to at least know.

209
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,710
Yeah, okay.

210
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,970
The CEO is going to review the car
on the 8th.

211
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,720
July 8th, so...

212
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,390
No, we gotta make that count.
That's a big show.

213
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,560
Either way, that's going to be
a very juicy week, so... strap in.

214
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,400
<i>If this goes over properly,</i>

215
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,110
<i>the bigger picture is that people
might change their perspective</i>

216
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,990
<i>of what this company's all about,
where we're headed.</i>

217
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,700
<i>You trust your gut instinct
that it's gonna work,</i>

218
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,450
<i>and eventually it'll become
a trendsetting design.</i>

219
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,120
<i>I think the best designs
are emotional forever.</i>

220
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,630
<i>You see an older 300,
it's almost 11 years old now,</i>

221
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,920
<i>and somehow they still look kind of cool,</i>

222
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,470
<i>because that emotion was there
from the beginning.</i>

223
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,350
<i>I was Chief of the Studio at the time
when this program was being developed.</i>

224
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,350
<i>The grill became a big part
of the car's theme.</i>

225
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,390
<i>But really, it harkened back
to the Virgil Exner</i>

226
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,480
<i>of '50s cars with aggressive,
oversized hoods.</i>

227
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,820
<i>Holding that DNA strand
is so critical to me.</i>

228
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,530
We kept making the grill
bigger and bigger and bigger,

229
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,610
until it felt right.

230
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,490
<i>It was a sensation.
And when it came out,</i>

231
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,160
<i>it was unlike anything we had seen
from an American car company in years.</i>

232
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,920
<i>The 300 was one
of Ralph's great designs</i>

233
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,630
because it has almost an African-American,
urban presence to it.

234
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,300
<i>It's got street cred, it looks cool.</i>

235
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,310
<i>He gave it these sleek windows,
a long hood and a short trunk,</i>

236
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,150
<i>and that gives it an impression of speed,
even when it's stopped.</i>

237
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,070
It just had kind of a badass look to it,

238
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,490
and a lot of people who really
didn't pay attention to Chrysler

239
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,620
<i>would know, "Oh! That's the 300."</i>

240
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,580
<i>The hip-hop crowd
took it under its wing.</i>

241
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,830
<i>The vehicle looks great
and it was affordable.</i>

242
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,330
<i>It was a pretty big deal for us.</i>

243
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,050
<i>We create a vehicle that someone
will not just own, but will cherish,</i>

244
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,930
<i>will create a community around,</i>

245
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,010
<i>and it's amazing.</i>

246
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,860
<i>I have an inner racer inside of me.</i>

247
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,110
<i>I've been watching racing
since I was a kid.</i>

248
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,110
<i>I went to four different driving schools
in a span of six years</i>

249
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,570
<i>and briefly competed.</i>

250
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,870
<i>But the part that speaks to me,
even to this day,</i>

251
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,750
<i>and why I go out of my way to do it...</i>

252
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,830
<i>is the escape.</i>

253
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,170
<i>When I'm driving a car,
literally, the world melts away.</i>

254
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,010
<i>You and the machine melt together.</i>

255
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,850
<i>Everything kind of goes in slow motion
and you're dancing with the car.</i>

256
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,240
<i>I come alive in a way.</i>

257
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,580
<i>The Viper is a big part
of what turned me on about Chrysler.</i>

258
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,500
<i>At the time the Viper came out,
it had double the horsepower of a Mustang.</i>

259
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,290
<i>It was the fastest car you could buy.</i>

260
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,010
<i>Insanely large engine,
a V10 that was eight liters,</i>

261
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,220
<i>I mean, just enormous.</i>

262
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,220
<i>And you could buy that car
for less than $50,000 when it came out.</i>

263
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,600
<i>So it was unheard of.</i>

264
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,600
<i>One of my favorite parts of this car
is not even the car itself,</i>

265
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,690
it's actually something
that happened when I picked it up.

266
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,900
So this is the very first ACR
to come off the line at Conner,

267
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,820
where they make all the Vipers.

268
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,070
And a lot of the people here
are very special.

269
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,280
They love this plant, you know,
it's kind of a second home for them.

270
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,750
<i>So when I went to pick up my car,
they started signing the car.</i>

271
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,710
<i>I think they knew in their mind
this car would be used as intended.</i>

272
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,380
Dave Bailey, he was Head of Engineer
for SRT for a very long time.

273
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,170
And here's Rustard Daselli,
he just retired,

274
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,220
he ran SRT with me
for the last four and a half years,

275
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,470
so, great people.

276
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,680
I can't even... This is priceless.

277
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,310
I will never sell this car
because of this, so...

278
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,570
<i>The acronym for SRT means
Street & Racing Technology.</i>

279
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,990
It's music, it's music.

280
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,740
<i>SRT was always about the Viper,</i>

281
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,830
<i>and then we started to fan out
its personality on the 300.</i>

282
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,660
<i>So we lowered the suspension,
made it look really sporty.</i>

283
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,430
<i>We showed it to management,
and they couldn't deny it. They're like,</i>

284
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,210
<i>"There's something cool about that,"
then one thing led to another,</i>

285
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,000
<i>and all of a sudden,
the SRT started going nuts.</i>

286
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,050
<i>We went from having two SRTs to ten.</i>

287
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,350
<i>America's always been about
value for the dollar.</i>

288
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,470
<i>You get Lamborghini, Ferrari performance</i>

289
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,020
in a car that the average American
could aspire to.

290
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,230
<i>I mean, it's the American success story.</i>

291
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,860
<i>The non-spoken part
of the SRT phenomenon</i>

292
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,030
<i>is the owners become kindred spirits.</i>

293
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,360
<i>They see each other
on the road, they wave at each other,</i>

294
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,386
<i>they go to car club events together,
they become friends because of the car.</i>

295
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,990
<i>Some people buy the SRTs
to be part of the community.</i>

296
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,370
Hey, John! Nice driving.

297
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,250
That was outstanding, by the way.

298
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,250
<i>That's a powerful thing.</i>

299
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,050
<i>I mean, it transcends much more
than what we do as designers.</i>

300
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,920
<i>It becomes popular culture.</i>

301
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,260
<i>And I think that's pretty cool.</i>

302
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,180
- Ready, honey?
- Uh-oh, it's time. All right.

303
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,600
Man, you make me work hard.

304
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,970
Let's go.

305
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,810
- All right.
- You ready?

306
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,190
Yep. Okay...

307
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,860
Gonna wave the flag
for Alfa Romeo today

308
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,400
and moms all over the world.

309
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,530
Way back when, I used to sit there
with a stopwatch and a pad of paper

310
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,370
and have to, like, record every lap
and all his lap times.

311
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,120
You're doing good.

312
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,960
Just a touch of brake here...

313
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,750
<i>And now that the kids are older,
we're looking for stuff to do together.</i>

314
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,420
Let's call this
your acceleration point.

315
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,090
So from here, every time I want you
to hit it full throttle

316
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,630
all the way to the braking zone.

317
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,140
<i>Ralph is intense.</i>

318
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,760
Like when he was teaching me
how to drive a stick,

319
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,270
like, if I get all flustered and I'm like,
"That's it, I'm done for today,"

320
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,940
he'll be like, "You get back in there."

321
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,110
Partial acceleration now,

322
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,480
and full right now.

323
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,230
Go. Full throttle, full throttle.

324
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,450
<i>But you know, he pushes me
and challenges me, so it's all good.</i>

325
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,120
Makes me cry every once in a while,
but that's okay.

326
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,170
<i>It's probably the toughest time
to be a designer in this industry,</i>

327
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,420
<i>because everyone's
hired each other by now.</i>

328
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,220
<i>Some of my best designers are working
for Korean companies now.</i>

329
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,890
<i>Have you noticed
the KIAs look pretty good lately?</i>

330
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,770
The only thing I would say,
the feeling of the structure...

331
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,770
It feels like a giant nipple.
Like you're toying with a teat.

332
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,560
Yeah.

333
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,230
If there's a way
to somehow put a cup in there to...

334
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,820
- To kind of...
- Guide you.

335
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,126
You're not going to roll it, right?

336
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,490
<i>The interiors have become
the new battleground for car design.</i>

337
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,700
<i>We design every square inch
of that interior to control the message,</i>

338
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,160
<i>make sure it's holistic.</i>

339
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,080
<i>To make it beautiful, functional.</i>

340
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:19,090
<i>We're thinking of a whole new way
of not just transporting your family,</i>

341
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,590
<i>but living in your car,
third-space solutions,</i>

342
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,630
<i>where you take what you love
about your home</i>

343
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,550
<i>into your transportation solution.</i>

344
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,310
So, our interior design team,
who can speak to the third-space idea?

345
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,470
The promise of autonomy,

346
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,116
a different way to interact
with your vehicle.

347
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,520
You're no longer controlling it,
you're more living in it.

348
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,570
So you have a cabin, which looks like
Daniel Boone would live there,

349
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,280
and then you have something
that Iron Man would live in.

350
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,400
I mean, glancing at them,
I don't know if I see coziness.

351
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,360
Yeah.

352
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,780
'Cause we've all been
to high-end hotels.

353
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,410
You go in the room, it's like,
I don't know, not cozy.

354
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,050
It's cool, but it's not cozy, you know?

355
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,540
I'd rather be...

356
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,960
But I love these,
they're very inspirational.

357
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,840
<i>We're living in exciting times.</i>

358
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,340
<i>I love the fact that there's
all this change, all this futurism.</i>

359
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,350
Once a vehicle becomes autonomous,
the driver also becomes the passenger.

360
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,100
<i>It's exciting to talk
about autonomous cars.</i>

361
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:21,570
<i>But when you think of autonomous cars,
you don't necessarily think of Detroit.</i>

362
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,650
<i>Right?</i>

363
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,900
And that kind of makes me mad.

364
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,200
<i>We're gonna catch up in a big way.
If anything, we need to lead.</i>

365
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,160
<i>There's a push now</i>

366
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,620
to have a national test center
for autonomous vehicles

367
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,700
here in Michigan.

368
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,500
<i>Detroit is going to play a big, big role</i>

369
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,130
<i>in how autonomous vehicles
become part of our lives.</i>

370
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,220
The beauty of this vehicle
being level four autonomous,

371
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,760
it allows the steering wheel device

372
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,680
to be able to tuck away
and come out towards you.

373
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,730
It creates drama and theater
when the car is turned on or turned off.

374
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,520
You can feel like
you're witnessing something special.

375
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,746
You're changing the discussion,
we're all changing the discussion

376
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,570
of can a car be a place
you look forward to being in.

377
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,570
Not something you just sit in
and you get there,

378
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,740
but it's actually a... it truly is
an extension of your home.

379
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,910
<i>I'm hugely conflicted
by this autonomous car movement.</i>

380
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,880
<i>As a leader of design
for a major corporation,</i>

381
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,540
<i>I have to step outside of my own body</i>

382
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,380
<i>and understand what the story
of autonomous cars is.</i>

383
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,646
<i>You would get it on the freeway,</i>

384
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,760
<i>then, once it's cruising,
the interior should reconfigure itself.</i>

385
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,300
<i>We have to respond to that.</i>

386
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:40,140
<i>But, the romantic car lover in me wonders
if one day, if everything is automated,</i>

387
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,870
<i>do people care about the car anymore,
or is it just another device?</i>

388
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,070
Just like a train or something,

389
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,280
or some other device
to get to work or whatever.

390
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,610
<i>But there's still
this solid base of people</i>

391
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,530
<i>that just love the freedom
and making their own decisions.</i>

392
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,620
I just hope we always have that choice

393
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,420
versus it being mandated to us,
what we're supposed to drive or not drive.

394
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,020
My father loved cool cars,
so inherently we just liked cars,

395
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,570
but we didn't have the privilege of having
all of these cool cars in our driveway.

396
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,610
Who made these cars so low?

397
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,240
<i>Again, you have to remember,
my dad was old school, you know.</i>

398
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,200
Doctor, engineer, lawyer,
that's the only thing.

399
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,160
<i>He knew I was mechanical.</i>

400
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,580
<i>I enjoyed the mechanical side
of the automobile as well,</i>

401
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,130
but the artistic side really appealed
to me much more.

402
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,880
The idea of taste making.

403
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,300
<i>So my aunt, who was a teacher herself,</i>

404
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,600
<i>saw something in that and wanted me
to cultivate the artistic side.</i>

405
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,890
<i>She was big on that.</i>

406
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,270
<i>And she most aggressively said,
"Hey, what are you going to do</i>

407
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,850
<i>with this thing you like to do?"</i>

408
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,440
<i>At the time, Lee lacocca was
making those famous commercials:</i>

409
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,940
"If you can find a better car, buy it."

410
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,836
<i>My aunt goes, "Lee lacocca,
that guy on TV,</i>

411
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,070
<i>write him a letter
and show him your drawings,</i>

412
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
<i>'cause you should work
for that car company."</i>

413
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,700
<i>It seemed so improbable.</i>

414
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,410
<i>Why this little kid from Montreal
would be of any significance to them.</i>

415
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,750
<i>But it felt like, "Hey, why not?"</i>

416
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,960
<i>They actually wrote back to me.</i>

417
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,590
"Dear Ralph, Mr. Iacocca has asked
that I answer your letter for him.

418
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,340
I looked over your portfolio

419
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,310
and believe that you have the potential
to have a career in automotive design."

420
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,060
<i>They recommended a few schools,</i>

421
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,560
<i>design schools that were in Michigan,
in Cleveland, and California.</i>

422
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,440
"Center for Creative Studies...

423
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,190
I hope I've been of some help to you.

424
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,490
Your portfolio does show
significant promise.

425
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,280
Regards, Neil Walling."

426
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,080
Does it move you,
when you read that?

427
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,170
Mm-hmm.

428
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,390
<i>Because of that letter,</i>

429
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,310
<i>I felt a certain draw and loyalty
to Chrysler.</i>

430
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,810
<i>So we've been working on this idea
in terms of a solution</i>

431
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,320
<i>for millennial vehicles
for about two years.</i>

432
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,410
<i>We've been going out
to speak to millennials,</i>

433
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,160
<i>just traveling across the country,
literally in their living rooms.</i>

434
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,370
<i>They often describe their issues,
their problems they're trying to solve.</i>

435
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,370
<i>As designers, we kind of listen in
really carefully to the problem</i>

436
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,330
<i>and say,
"Okay, today there isn't a vehicle</i>

437
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,630
<i>that solves two of those problems
at the same time."</i>

438
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,460
<i>We're trying to create products
that solve multiple problems,</i>

439
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,380
<i>and in so doing, you create
a white space,</i>

440
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,106
<i>meaning there's nothing there.
It's a canvas.</i>

441
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,390
<i>It's wide open
for you to develop the answer.</i>

442
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,440
What do you guys think about
scrunching down the bumper pad?

443
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,150
Or the...

444
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,940
It would look so much better
with a little more breathing room.

445
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,280
The bumper...

446
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,280
Hey, Dunford,
I think you're going to like it.

447
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,450
If you like it, I like it.

448
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,950
Stop!

449
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,870
When I grow up, I want to be a yes-man.
Just...

450
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,620
Any comments from anyone else?

451
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,380
Everything is pretty symmetrical,
but yet the wheel isn't.

452
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,500
Glad you said that.

453
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,340
- Let's go look at it.
- All right.

454
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,420
I mean, the easy fix is
to stretch the wheel base.

455
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,630
- Now. Not...
- Yeah.

456
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,590
A year from now, it will very hard.

457
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:47,640
One area I keep staring at
is the radius on especially the rear door,

458
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,180
as it transitions.

459
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,730
And I think now,
if you move that wheel back...

460
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,860
- Can you...
- Let it breathe?

461
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,456
Let it breathe. It feels like it's forcing
its way around the wheel.

462
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,070
You can actually see
the highlight crashing with that.

463
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,200
The front one is perfect. Let's do that.

464
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,030
Let's call it 40 mils,
I think 40 mils is perfect.

465
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,160
- You can go too far quick, you know?
- Oh, yeah. You can. Yeah.

466
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,370
It'll come alive.
No, nice job. What can I say?

467
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,960
- Good stuff.
- Thank you.

468
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,130
- Good stuff.
- Sounds good.

469
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,340
Good stuff, John. No, no, you get a hug.

470
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,720
<i>If you think about
family formation</i>

471
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,760
<i>and the way
people have transported families,</i>

472
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,140
<i>you had the station wagon,
then you had the minivan.</i>

473
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,640
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>

474
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,900
<i>you had a vehicle that was
80% people space, 20% mechanical space</i>

475
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,150
<i>in terms of volume.</i>

476
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,480
<i>People recognize that right away.</i>

477
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,360
<i>And from 1984 onwards,
it has been a success story.</i>

478
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,990
<i>They've always been
sort of boom or bust.</i>

479
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,870
<i>The K-car.
Oh, we did a million jokes about that.</i>

480
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,830
Cars A through J, how bad were they
if this is the K-car?

481
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,380
<i>The irony is they took
the base of the K-car,</i>

482
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,050
and they put a big roof on it
and turned it into the minivan.

483
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,590
<i>Boom!
They're rolling in dough again.</i>

484
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,220
<i>They're making a ton of dough,</i>

485
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,350
but you've got to reinvent yourself
every single year

486
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,510
in the automobile business.

487
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,020
<i>1987, the Portofino
concept car came out.</i>

488
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,600
<i>I remember seeing that concept car</i>

489
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,400
<i>and going, "Whoa, here are
the people that make the Caravan."</i>

490
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,650
<i>And it floored me.</i>

491
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
<i>The '90s.</i>

492
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,990
<i>That's when the company was healthy.</i>

493
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,080
<i>The Concord came out, the LHS,</i>

494
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,670
<i>the Chronos concept,</i>

495
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,170
<i>the 300 concept...</i>

496
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,380
<i>to try to remind the world
that we had that in us.</i>

497
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,140
<i>It's funny how it kind of goes...</i>

498
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,470
<i>Like, you're flying high,
then you hit a wall,</i>

499
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,760
<i>you hit an economic something
and then you're low again,</i>

500
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,640
<i>and then you always try
to get back to that.</i>

501
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,020
<i>That happy place.</i>

502
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,530
<i>We think the house is steady right now,</i>

503
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:08,160
<i>so it's time again to do a vehicle that
tells the world where we want to be going.</i>

504
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,250
<i>Taste making takes time.</i>

505
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,370
<i>I believe what we do as designers
is create taste.</i>

506
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
Hello!

507
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,050
All right, where am I going to be,
right here?

508
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,970
<i>Sometimes we're a little bit ahead
of culture, or ahead of the times</i>

509
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,800
<i>and we challenge it
and we hear that noise.</i>

510
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,640
<i>It happens all the time
on a creative vehicle</i>

511
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,770
<i>that is either loved or very much hated.</i>

512
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,890
The way it's laid out on the table,
it's cozy, earthy and then...

513
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,060
- Yes.
- Technical.

514
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,710
- There are stories behind that.
- There are stories behind that.

515
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,070
<i>So the perfect example
is the Jeep Cherokee,</i>

516
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,900
<i>very controversial vehicle.</i>

517
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,620
<i>We came at it with a different objective:
to shock people, almost.</i>

518
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,490
<i>It has a very unique face,
but it's still a Jeep.</i>

519
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,000
<i>But with the Jeep brand it's different,</i>

520
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,870
<i>because you have a brand
that's as recognized</i>

521
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,290
<i>as Disney and Coca-Cola,</i>

522
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,800
and people tend to watch what you do,
so if you get it wrong,

523
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,210
you get it really wrong.

524
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,260
<i>Jeep is
the most important brand Chrysler has.</i>

525
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,390
<i>And you want to talk about pressure,</i>

526
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,810
doing a new vehicle from scratch
is about a billion-dollar investment.

527
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,150
<i>So you've got to know
what consumers are going to want</i>

528
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,480
<i>even before consumers
know what they want.</i>

529
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,610
The main show car
that represents the future wants to be...

530
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,450
That's kind of where my...
just my instincts.

531
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,490
- Sounds good.
- What do you guys think?

532
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,910
- We were more...
- You're there.

533
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah.

534
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,670
<i>I can barely sleep when we're
in the throes of those projects.</i>

535
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,226
It's like, "Oh, my gosh, I have
so many customers to make happy,

536
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,130
and we haven't even started talking
about the ones on the outside."

537
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,440
<i>And over time, it just looks better
as people become more familiar.</i>

538
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,910
<i>And all of a sudden, it becomes
the new thing and others emulate it.</i>

539
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,580
<i>You have to have the intestinal fortitude</i>

540
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,950
<i>to be able to kind of make it
through that initial step</i>

541
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,460
<i>and also recognize designs
that will age gracefully.</i>

542
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,630
Come up with
some color options, for sure..

543
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,550
It definitely feels anti-car,
and I really don't like the wheels.

544
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,380
- But we'll talk about that another time.
- Yeah, yeah. Yep.

545
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,720
When do we run out of time?
I know we...

546
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,060
We're working towards the 7/8 show
and it'll be a show like this.

547
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:39,850
Better wheels.

548
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,520
Better wheels,
we'll get you better wheels, for sure.

549
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,230
<i>My whole life, I programmed myself
to believe I would become an engineer,</i>

550
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,320
<i>just go that direction.</i>

551
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,360
<i>And for me, it was always,
"Okay, let's go. Let's do this."</i>

552
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,450
<i>I went to college in Canada,</i>

553
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,870
and I'll never forget...
I felt this hollow sensation in my heart,

554
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,370
like, "Is this going to be
the path I take?"

555
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,250
<i>I remember being in school</i>

556
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,370
<i>and everything started turning
a different language.</i>

557
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,630
<i>I wasn't understanding it,</i>

558
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,380
<i>I was trying to sketch
and struggling with it.</i>

559
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,850
Then eventually, after...
I don't even think it was even five weeks,

560
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,890
I dropped out.
I literally dropped out of college.

561
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,970
<i>I didn't know how to break it to my dad.</i>

562
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,600
<i>I mean, I couldn't even
form the words in my mouth.</i>

563
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,150
<i>I didn't expect that it was going to be
so cold in the house.</i>

564
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,610
<i>Every day I'd come home and it was like
you could just sense the disgust.</i>

565
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,980
<i>You could just sense this kind of
"What has happened?"</i>

566
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,410
<i>Probably, in many ways, my darkest hour.</i>

567
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,340
<i>Starting in 1998,
it was yet another dark period.</i>

568
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,590
<i>And I felt it coming.</i>

569
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,980
<i>When I heard
we were merging with Mercedes,</i>

570
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,140
<i>I'm like, "Why? We're fine.
We don't need that."</i>

571
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,020
<i>And then, two years into the deal,
things were strange.</i>

572
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,150
<i>You could feel the product
being under-invested in.</i>

573
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,860
<i>And it absolutely
almost cost us our livelihood,</i>

574
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,570
<i>and cost us the entire company.</i>

575
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,990
<i>Mercedes divested
and pretty much left us for dead.</i>

576
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,580
<i>A private equity firm came in
and bought us.</i>

577
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,000
<i>It was horrible.</i>

578
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:30,670
<i>So I became Head of Design in 2008,
but they moved me under Engineering.</i>

579
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,800
<i>And that's a kiss of death.</i>

580
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,720
<i>That just says that design
is a function of engineering,</i>

581
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,430
<i>not an important piece.</i>

582
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,430
<i>On top of the product being sick,
there was an economic downturn coming</i>

583
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,140
<i>and it was just a perfect storm.</i>

584
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,560
<i>Two months later, they enacted
a voluntary termination program</i>

585
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,820
<i>and nearly half the population
of Chrysler vanished overnight.</i>

586
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,160
<i>I felt like a captain on a ship.</i>

587
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,410
<i>You know, "I'll be the last one
to get off this boat,</i>

588
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:06,200
<i>but I'm not leaving
until the doors are closed."</i>

589
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:12,460
<i>I remember going home for Christmas
to my mom's place</i>

590
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,800
<i>and just not knowing what was going on,</i>

591
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,470
<i>just not understanding
what was going to happen next,</i>

592
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,630
<i>not knowing if I'd even come back
to a company</i>

593
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,260
<i>after the holidays were over.</i>

594
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,930
<i>For some reason, I didn't worry,</i>

595
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,810
<i>I knew in the back of my mind
it'll be okay. I had my family.</i>

596
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,290
<i>For as ugly as it was,
I wouldn't change it.</i>

597
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,460
<i>I'm not fazed by anything anymore.
You know, I can handle it.</i>

598
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,380
<i>I only lost 3% of my staff during
the voluntary termination program,</i>

599
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,430
<i>whereas most of the company lost 40-50%,</i>

600
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,470
<i>and that's because we were working
on the future.</i>

601
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,020
<i>That lesson is singed in my mind forever.</i>

602
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,480
<i>No matter how tough times are,
you just do not compromise the product.</i>

603
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,320
<i>You just don't.</i>

604
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,740
<i>It wasn't until 2011 when we started
to dig ourselves out of the hole.</i>

605
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,500
<i>The government gave us a loan.</i>

606
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,630
<i>They didn't give us free money.</i>

607
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:37,170
<i>This was a loan,
a very high-interest loan.</i>

608
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,510
<i>And we paid it off in full.</i>

609
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,170
<i>And this was only on the condition
that we were managed,</i>

610
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,970
<i>so luckily FIAT decided to come in
and manage the company.</i>

611
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,560
<i>Sergio came in almost like a knight
waiting to swoop in and save Chrysler.</i>

612
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,100
<i>I think I know
how to lead people.</i>

613
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:57,060
And the ones that we have here
are phenomenal people.

614
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,660
<i>Sergio named me Head of Design
for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.</i>

615
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:15,120
<i>But, you know, the global design role
that I have now,</i>

616
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,790
I wanted to tell the Italians, "I get it."

617
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,420
You know, I wanted
to be seen in their sport.

618
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,050
<i>I've gotta patch a lot of history
in my head.</i>

619
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,890
<i>I didn't grow up in Italy,
I didn't spend time there.</i>

620
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,310
The vehicle I drove was 50 years old,
and people are still in love with it.

621
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,440
<i>I want to do that.</i>

622
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,650
When I come to work,
I want it to have been done so lovingly

623
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:49,070
<i>that people get that,
they see that care in the design...</i>

624
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,830
decades from now.

625
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,420
<i>One of the most beautiful cars.</i>

626
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,840
I agree. Thank you. It's not
my car, I'm driving it for a friend...

627
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,550
- Oh, you're a lucky guy!
- Extremely!

628
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,930
- Yeah!
- All right, ready?

629
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,230
<i>I use the expression
we've been "common law" with FIAT</i>

630
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,650
<i>for about five years,
so it's a re-education.</i>

631
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,990
<i>When I took over the global role,
it was extremely intimidating.</i>

632
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:31,830
<i>I'm launched into
not only global executive meetings,</i>

633
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,250
<i>but also how do I carry these brands,
not being an Italian?</i>

634
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:38,346
There's going to be a lot of eyes on me,
and I know that. It makes me nervous,

635
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,750
but it's also
extremely, extremely exciting.

636
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,670
<i>We're working on
the next four or five Alfa Romeos</i>

637
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,590
<i>coming out in the next decade or so.</i>

638
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,510
<i>Looking at it through the lens
of an Italian designer is unique.</i>

639
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,746
<i>Because I have paradigms
that I've grown up with</i>

640
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:59,850
<i>and I'm trying to push those down
and distill the product for what it is.</i>

641
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,570
<i>It's a completely
different challenge</i>

642
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,030
<i>to design a Maserati and a Fiat.</i>

643
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,910
A Maserati, you know,
that's a $150,000 car.

644
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:21,170
<i>Every last stitch, curve, contour
has to be perfect.</i>

645
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,880
<i>I'm kind of rooting for the guy</i>

646
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,670
<i>just because it's nice to see
somebody from Detroit</i>

647
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:32,260
be able to put his stamp
on a global luxury brand like Maserati.

648
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,640
<i>Working with Klaus now,
who's Head of Design,</i>

649
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,440
<i>I go in and I direct a little bit,
but I really want Klaus to run the show.</i>

650
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,310
So as you see this car, Klaus,

651
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,190
how much of a pilot light is this for
the future of Maserati in your opinion?

652
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:51,070
I think spiritually,
it very much is not only the future,

653
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,200
but also the past and the now of Maserati

654
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,580
where you just have beautiful execution,
beautiful surfacing,

655
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:01,460
but then you have some of these details
that add this character.

656
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:07,000
There's something compelling.
You know me, it's all about proportion.

657
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:10,590
I feel like this car has
just fundamentally good bones.

658
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,220
The wheels are at the right place,
the tumble...

659
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,850
Everything is where it should be
for this kind of car.

660
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:19,480
Announcing its presence, its power.
That's pretty awesome.

661
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,650
<i>I don't want to hold their hands,
I don't want to do their job for them.</i>

662
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:31,320
<i>I want the Italians to do their car.
I want that car to ooze Italianness.</i>

663
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,580
<i>Here's a brand I've loved
since I was a kid,</i>

664
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,250
<i>and I get to play a role
in its future development.</i>

665
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:49,210
<i>I can't believe it.
I mean, I still pinch myself.</i>

666
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:56,390
<i>I was living at home, you know,
pretty much hiding in the basement.</i>

667
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,510
Then my brother comes home.

668
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,140
He comes home for spring break.
And he didn't have to come home.

669
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,190
He could've gone to Florida
with his buddies,

670
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:06,060
but he decided
to go to freezing cold Montreal...

671
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,270
and go see his brother.

672
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,610
<i>I remember I came home
to find him in the basement,</i>

673
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:15,530
<i>just buried in papers
of drawings of cars everywhere.</i>

674
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:20,490
What I just saw was a young kid
sitting, wasting his talent.

675
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,040
It was just obviously there,
right in front of him.

676
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,710
He just didn't know what to do.

677
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,960
<i>He asked me
about that letter from Chrysler.</i>

678
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,646
<i>And he said,
"Are you going to do anything with that?</i>

679
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:35,180
<i>Are you going to follow your dreams?
Are you going to try be a car designer?"</i>

680
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,800
<i>So we called Center for Creative Studies,</i>

681
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,220
<i>and they, on the phone,
described what we needed to do.</i>

682
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,770
<i>It was past the deadline,
I remember that.</i>

683
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,060
<i>We said, "Let's just pick
your best pictures."</i>

684
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,480
<i>I kept him up all night, saying,
"We got to do this.</i>

685
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,310
You have a gift,
let's just get this done."

686
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,030
<i>He made me coffee,</i>

687
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,610
<i>tried everything he could
to keep me pumped up, and...</i>

688
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,570
And he wasn't going to go away
until I rolled up that stuff

689
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,240
and sent it to Detroit.

690
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,500
So yeah, that's a pretty big deal for me.
To follow your dreams.

691
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,720
<i>We've got seven months
of energy and labor,</i>

692
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,760
<i>and love and meetings
and cutting room floor ideas</i>

693
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,350
<i>that are all coming to this moment.</i>

694
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,100
<i>If it's too shallow,
or it's not thought out enough,</i>

695
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:29,690
<i>the boss could tank it,
and we probably would understand that.</i>

696
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:35,070
<i>We had a full-size clay to approximate
the entire volume of the vehicle,</i>

697
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,120
<i>and we had the physical property that
approximated the space of the interior</i>

698
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,500
<i>and how it would feel in the dual sliding,
Bombay-type doors.</i>

699
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,750
We should be painting that,
so it gives that lightness.

700
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,250
'Cause I'm missing some of that,

701
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:52,840
what was in the sketches,
where that upper bar is floating.

702
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,920
Know what I mean?

703
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,510
It doesn't feel celebrated enough.

704
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,550
It looks like an old property.

705
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:01,220
He's so programmed to expect
things of importance to be there,

706
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,180
I would keep it...

707
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,310
Everything that matters there,
and the support stuff sprinkled around.

708
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,730
- You know?
- And with this?

709
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,060
<i>Oh, man, nervous.</i>

710
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,690
Sergio's such an intelligent person.
He's on a different wavelength.

711
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,070
<i>And I challenge myself
to get ready for any eventuality,</i>

712
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,440
<i>any question he may have.</i>

713
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,820
In fact, I would move
all of that stuff here.

714
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,530
To me, this is background, that's primary.

715
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,450
Yeah.

716
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:26,790
This is some beautiful content
that should be all there.

717
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,040
<i>I'm hoping today
we can fill that void for him</i>

718
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,210
<i>that I think he's aware that we have.</i>

719
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:35,920
But, I'm optimistic
that he will be inspired.

720
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,050
That's what I'm hoping, to stay hungry.

721
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:44,350
Hello!

722
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,220
<i>So today we're here to talk about</i>

723
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:48,430
<i>a concept vehicle
that's really trying to define</i>

724
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,160
<i>this third space for the next generation.</i>

725
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:59,740
<i>I got my job in 1992.
I got married right at that same time.</i>

726
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:01,700
<i>My dad was pretty proud.</i>

727
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,580
For me, I felt like, step one,
"Wow, he's actually proud."

728
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,750
<i>Unfortunately, he passed
in the fall of 1998,</i>

729
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:14,630
just right before I got promoted,
just before I had my child.

730
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,760
<i>He didn't really, unfortunately, see me
become a manager, then a director,</i>

731
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,220
<i>and it really hurt me.</i>

732
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:28,020
<i>Because I went from being a worker bee,
so to speak, to a leader, you know.</i>

733
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,810
And I don't know if my dad
ever saw me as a leader.

734
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,570
<i>All right, who thinks
Ralph is our new King of the Hill?</i>

735
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,280
<i>I wish he could see this today,</i>

736
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:51,710
and just know that his encouragement,
or his pushing, worked.

737
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,340
Waah!

738
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,050
That was cheesy, but I want
to give you guys a round of applause.

739
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,590
<i>That was freaking awesome.
That's about as good as it gets.</i>

740
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,930
Sergio turned around and said,
"This is really good stuff.

741
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,640
This is some of the best stuff
I've seen in a long time."

742
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,190
<i>Whether it's a windshield wiper
or an engine cover,</i>

743
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,030
<i>it all has to be done with love.</i>

744
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,400
<i>The observer recognizes that.</i>

745
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,780
Can we get a fire pit in the middle?

746
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,830
<i>Wow, someone
really cared about that.</i>

747
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:32,830
<i>And that's good design
and, ultimately, that's good art.</i>

748
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,960
<i>We're staffing up to make the vehicle.</i>

749
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,460
We're building it.
