1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,218
I would like to design
an experiment with you.

2
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,055
This means that you and I
are gonna collaborate and...

3
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:17,934
for that to happen, it would be great
if you could turn off...

4
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,397
any other light than the screen
you're looking at.

5
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:27,110
You could pause the episode here
and sort it out,

6
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:28,987
but think of...

7
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,490
the screen, the TV, as a lamp.

8
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,537
You shouldn't, uh, look at the screen,
look at the space around the screen

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,165
and pay attention
to how you are in that space.

10
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,500
But let's... let's just get started.
So, check this out.

11
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,961
First, I'm gonna start
by making it yellow.

12
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,173
I like the color yellow,

13
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,842
but see how the room
is in fact now yellow.

14
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,636
Enjoy the yellow.

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,639
Maybe take a deep breath.

16
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,225
Let's change that color.

17
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,189
Do you see how your room suddenly changed?

18
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,402
Red light makes you more calm,
it makes you tired. It relaxes you.

19
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,492
Where, with a certain blue color,
you stay awake.

20
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:21,039
So, every color has a sort
of different way of influencing us.

21
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,833
This is what art is about.

22
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,795
You are a co-author with me,

23
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,382
the main protagonist.
What you see is quite up to you.

24
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,643
Olafur Eliasson:

25
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,854
artist, architect, and design phenom.

26
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,274
In Olafur's work,
you first have a "wow,"

27
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,819
and then you have an "aha."

28
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,576
Olafur Eliasson is celebrated

29
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,746
for creating immersive spaces
and experiences.

30
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,001
He's truly an artist
who interacts with his environment.

31
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:12,090
Eliasson is an expert
in the art of smoke and mirrors.

32
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,760
There is no artist on the planet

33
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,555
operating on a more global scale
than Olafur.

34
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:27,897
To him, changing the world means
changing the way we experience the world.

35
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,959
This is my studio in Berlin,
and, um...

36
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,546
the studio is really a place where...

37
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,175
I and the team,
we work together making art.

38
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,345
I love my studio
being exciting and magical

39
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,349
and capable of doing things
that otherwise would be hard to do,

40
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,809
because we just play a lot.

41
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,812
It's not rational, it's not pragmatic.

42
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,023
I mean, it's about making art.

43
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:15,236
So, it's not like walking out of reality
into some kind of dream world, right?

44
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,821
You actually walk into the studio

45
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,365
and you see the real world
in a microscope.

46
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,619
The mirror is looking to the center
at the moment.

47
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,889
Yeah, but that means
the mirror is looking to the center

48
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,164
but is on the side of the ball.

49
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,332
- Yes.
- Okay.

50
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,334
I mean, there's so much going on

51
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,212
that you don't really look...

52
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,088
carefully enough.

53
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,938
I think it's maybe more interesting if...

54
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,594
maybe they are connected like this?

55
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,931
Because somehow the baits
are taking too much attention.

56
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,850
Okay, great. Let's go on.

57
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,896
Phil? Yeah.

58
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,025
Olafur likes...

59
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,361
different kind of materials,

60
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,572
different way to structure things.

61
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,118
So, that openness lead him to...

62
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,371
a new type of art.

63
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,128
A lot of my work
is exploring this notion of...

64
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,216
what we consider truth
depends on how you look at it.

65
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,179
We create reality as we go through space.

66
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,645
When you look at a work of art,

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,941
it is as if it is looking at you.

68
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,944
You are the one who's being listened to.

69
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,620
My work is completely dependent
on the spectator

70
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,123
turning ideas into art.

71
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,711
And that's the same thing
with, you know, a Netflix space.

72
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,172
Obviously, we have a situation
where somebody's watching, right?

73
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,091
Hello. And then,

74
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,719
I assume there's a kind of a screen.

75
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,516
Maybe it is interesting to explore
what these people are actually looking at.

76
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,393
I mean, what's actually going on.

77
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,982
The thing is,
this is a constructed situation.

78
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,150
Let me just show you.

79
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,278
See this? This is you...
This is you and the camera, right?

80
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,323
Look, it's like I'm surrounded
with all these people here.

81
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,366
I mean, what we take for granted...

82
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,744
"Oh, he's talking to the camera,"
is actually...

83
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,667
I wouldn't say it's manipulated,
but, you know,

84
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,081
it's... for sure it's constructed, right?

85
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,708
A little bit like this episode.

86
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:38,129
Okay, here. Why don't you
talk to Mark? Here, hold on a second.

87
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,715
So, when I started,
I was really interested in...

88
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,468
what was between the walls.

89
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,429
I mean, that invisible thing,
which is, I guess...

90
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,641
I guess it's just air,
but how can I just show the nothingness?

91
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:56,272
So, one of my very first works
was an attempt to make a rainbow.

92
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,276
I thought about how is a rainbow made.

93
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,488
But the truth is, there's not much to it.

94
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:08,451
It's about the angle of the eye,
the drop, and the light.

95
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,079
And if there is no eye,

96
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,082
then that angle is not there
and then there is no rainbow.

97
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,626
The person next to you
doesn't see your rainbow,

98
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,544
because that eye is somewhere else.

99
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,966
This is a space totally dependent
on you being there.

100
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:29,138
When you leave the exhibition,
there's nobody in the room.

101
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,391
There's also no art.

102
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,478
It's not about a rainbow, really.
It's really about...

103
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,731
"Do I trust my own eyes
and my own capacity to...

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,775
engage in the world?"

105
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,532
So, why do I make what I make, right?

106
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,754
I grew up in Denmark,
and I spent a lot of time...

107
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,173
with my father in Iceland.

108
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,054
And using water, or mist, or light
just came natural to me.

109
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,143
And I like referencing the nature
in my work.

110
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,855
See if I can film people looking at it.

111
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,568
Sorry, there's no photography
allowed in here.

112
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,447
Okay. Uh, I am, uh, the artist.
I'm sure it's okay. Thank you.

113
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,369
Nature became a kind of a way for me

114
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,204
to create a language

115
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,999
which people could relate to.

116
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,546
Because everybody knows a rainbow.

117
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,301
It's a natural phenomena
and something very easily accessible.

118
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,721
And because the water is kind of falling,
you're suddenly conscious

119
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,306
about time is passing somehow.

120
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,851
That's why I like this waterfall a lot

121
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,437
because it's great
to just get a sense of the scale

122
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,107
simply by looking
at the speed of the water as it falls.

123
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,904
That's why I took this waterfall
and I made it under the Brooklyn Bridge.

124
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,118
Because looking at that

125
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,246
from Manhattan, for instance, you realize,

126
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,957
"Oh, my God.
The Brooklyn Bridge is so big...

127
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,338
and the distance across the East River
is very long."

128
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,675
And once you know
the size of the waterfall,

129
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,803
you also know the size of your own body.

130
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,099
And this is where
it gets interesting, right?

131
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,812
It's not so much about the mountain
or the landscape and nature and so on,

132
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:42,896
it's about us.

133
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,999
Who has the courage

134
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,168
to do something of this scale?

135
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,378
It's enormous.

136
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:12,426
You have to be so sure in your idea

137
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,012
that you're willing to take that big risk.

138
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,183
And you don't find that
that often in artists.

139
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,274
So, the way I always work

140
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,485
is that, obviously,
things start with an idea, right?

141
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,779
So, an idea is like... like here, right?

142
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:36,867
And then, immediately, you have a problem
that the idea doesn't have any words.

143
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,956
And there's that lovely, interesting space
before you verbalize your idea.

144
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,518
On top of that, the idea
comes from somewhere, right?

145
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,460
So, there's something before the idea.

146
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,506
That's an interesting space too, right?
Because where do we get ideas from?

147
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,594
I get ideas when I work hard.

148
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,017
Collaboration is very much
at the heart of my work.

149
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,228
This is the work we talked about,

150
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:08,065
and these are the colors that we ordered.

151
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,526
I need to give the idea language,

152
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,653
and the answer to what language is

153
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,488
is to maybe analyze a little bit,

154
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,993
"Why on earth did I get that idea?
Why am I interested in that?"

155
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,372
So, this is the space
where I make drawings

156
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,916
because I don't know
how to put words on it.

157
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,171
The next step is in the language, right?

158
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:34,216
I'm very happy to have an amazing team
who take the language

159
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,592
and the drawing,

160
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,511
and then we start making models.

161
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,847
I'll just write here, "model."

162
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:42,933
Oh, it's great.

163
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:47,188
And these models,
they... they kind of give the idea

164
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,566
and the drawing dimensionality.
Suddenly, it becomes about space.

165
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,781
And this is actually a work I'm doing
for an exhibition in Los Angeles

166
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,366
at, um...

167
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,326
at a... a gallery,

168
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,662
here now, in two months,

169
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,289
which is about smaller works,

170
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,833
things that you can put in your own house.

171
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,795
It needs to be a bit more...

172
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,755
- Like in a lighter...
- Right. Yeah, brighter.

173
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,006
- You're right.
- Yeah.

174
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,885
My role is to make sure
that it's a work of art, and...

175
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,513
what drives every decision is

176
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,682
not how, but why.

177
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,353
The team is trying to come up
with a "how,"

178
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,063
so my role is like the...

179
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,856
the "why" person.

180
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,108
Should we bend it back a bit?

181
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,609
Yeah. Take it back a bit.

182
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,693
That's too much.

183
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,156
I remember early on,

184
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,703
Olafur, I visited him in the studio,
and he'd installed a light

185
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,746
that I perceived as yellow,

186
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,124
and I only understood gradually

187
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,209
that I didn't see any other colors.

188
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,962
All of a sudden,
everything was black and white and gray.

189
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,925
I came across a lamp
that takes away all the colors.

190
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,032
And I thought, "Oh, it's a miracle."

191
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,599
So, this is monochromatic light.
So, it looks like there is no colors.

192
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,309
I mean, there is in fact no colors here,

193
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,187
because there is no white light
to bounce it back onto us.

194
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,772
But have a look at this.

195
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,611
It's the prismatic colors,
it's the rainbow.

196
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,906
All the colors are actually there.

197
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,871
One of my very first exhibitions

198
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,623
had a huge yellow room

199
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,543
for people to look at their hands
and go like,

200
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,879
"The color's gone."

201
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,259
It turned out that the absence of color

202
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,637
kind of makes you more attentive
to everything else.

203
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,931
We kind of see more.

204
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,642
But the museum director said,

205
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:52,438
"You are not just gonna make
an empty, yellow room."

206
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,315
He was, like, on his knees,

207
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,610
"Can't we put just one small red rose
on the floor,

208
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,196
so that when you look at it,
it's not red anymore?"

209
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,782
And I said, "No,

210
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,534
because then the show
is about a red rose."

211
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,580
Though sometimes
you get obsessed with "how"

212
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,374
and then you sort of lose sight
of why we're doing it.

213
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,007
I kept using the yellow light.

214
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,302
I did a few works with it,
which were very minimal.

215
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:28,098
And when I was working very close
with a great curator at the Tate...

216
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,436
I thought of, um...

217
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
the weather.

218
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,857
This is now 2003,

219
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:41,237
and for me, personally, it was where
consciousness about the climate started.

220
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,282
But the Weather Project,

221
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,577
to do it was a long process.

222
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,332
Where I actually ended up building
a huge model of the space

223
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,959
that I could walk in.

224
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,754
It was very much about, "How can I make

225
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,257
the air, or the void, or the atmosphere

226
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,674
visible?"

227
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,636
And that's how I got to think of fog.

228
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,724
Once you look up,

229
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,644
I wanted to block out the skylight.

230
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:20,818
And then I decided to have mirrors
to make the space appear even bigger.

231
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,824
Then I thought, "Why don't I do just
half a sphere, and the other half will be

232
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,201
in the mirror,

233
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,203
which also then somehow

234
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,039
suggests that it is
actually twice the height,

235
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,334
because the eye and the brain
is actually easily fooled.

236
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,046
And luckily, it looked like the model.

237
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,387
The monochromatic yellow light

238
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,808
gives you this otherworldly sense
of, you know, a kind of artificial sky.

239
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,395
That's why I called it
the Weather Project.

240
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,692
And it was clear that people
were having very different experiences.

241
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,486
Some said, "Oh, my God.
This is doom and gloom.

242
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,155
It's about apocalypse."

243
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,576
And some people said, "Oh, it's about,
you know, contemplative spirituality

244
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,369
and I need to do some yoga."

245
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,125
And interestingly,
these two versions of it

246
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,543
could still be together.

247
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,258
You don't have to be the same
in order to share a space.

248
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,973
And the yellow light, I think,
was a key driver

249
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,099
in that whole thing.

250
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,607
The Weather Project marked
a certain paradigm change

251
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,234
in how people perceive contemporary art.

252
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,863
It's something that's relevant
to the way how you see the world.

253
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,203
And it made him much more known
in a much wider audience.

254
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,001
We got it.
Thank you so much.

255
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,460
Cheers.

256
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,212
Good.

257
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,216
What do you say, "It's a wrap?"
How do you say that?

258
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,052
- Not yet.
- Oh, not yet. I see, okay.

259
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,315
So, now we're
on the southern coast...

260
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:28,320
of Iceland, and here, this is actually
not too far from where my father lived.

261
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,324
My father was an artist.

262
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,036
I actually think
my father's first painting

263
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,663
is sort of a black beach.

264
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,164
Maybe this is here.

265
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,586
- Do we have my father's films?
- Yeah, we do.

266
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,091
He was a very playful artist
who did many different things,

267
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,135
and I guess maybe that's why he was not...

268
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,263
successful as an artist.
He couldn't live from it.

269
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,724
That's my father.

270
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:01,770
As a child, I was kind of scared
that he had a cast of his own head.

271
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,440
So, always in my father's studio,
there was this...

272
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,524
his head,

273
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,526
sitting on a pedestal.

274
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,195
My father was a little bit crazy.

275
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,156
My parents were divorced,

276
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,700
and probably because
I was living with my mother,

277
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,703
I thought that everything my father did
was, like, amazing.

278
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,705
Of course I wanted him

279
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,289
to like me so much,

280
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,460
so when I stayed with my mother,
I always would send my father drawings.

281
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,963
And my father would tell me
to send him new drawings.

282
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,424
All in all, I had pretty good support.

283
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,596
But what more influenced me
was maybe the fact that...

284
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,975
what I did
did not necessarily have to, um...

285
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,852
I don't know how to say it exactly.

286
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:46,607
It... It didn't have to be successful
in order to be quality.

287
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,528
So, now that I'm a parent...

288
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,324
I try to not push...

289
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,533
my kids.

290
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,744
It was...

291
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,748
It sounds...
It sort of sounds wrong today, right?

292
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,792
But my parent actually did not...

293
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,004
ask me to do something seriously.

294
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,589
That's interesting.

295
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,100
- Is this going to LA as well?
- It is.

296
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,852
Okay, we have to work on the lights, uh,
on these ones here.

297
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,854
Yeah, okay. So, we got this one.

298
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,234
Oh, this looks really bad.
It doesn't work at all.

299
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,317
Okay.

300
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,572
So, this one,
it's really strong and really white...

301
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,742
- Yes.
- To create some structure on the wall.

302
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,577
That's a lot nicer now.

303
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,788
- This is much better.
- Yeah?

304
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,999
- Brita, can you turn it on?
- Sure.

305
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,175
I like that the purple got so dark
that it looks black.

306
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,221
But then, when you look closer,
it's actually very, very deep purple.

307
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,058
It's almost a pity, uh...

308
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,310
to send it away.

309
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,148
It's... It's not the one
I'm keeping, is it?

310
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,358
No, no. It's for the LA show.

311
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,609
Oh, horrible.

312
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,824
What makes a space tolerable,
more inclusive?

313
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,413
The body is a good indicator.

314
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,590
Who knows about the body?

315
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,008
Dancers.

316
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,180
I believe it was '83,

317
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,308
maybe '82, actually, so it was very early.

318
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:51,064
In a store window, there was these people
mimicking a mannequin,

319
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,876
and then they would move like a robot.

320
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,241
It really totally and utterly
blew my mind.

321
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,078
And it was as if I had seen the light.

322
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,917
Just like a whole new world
just opened for me.

323
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,086
And I could not stop moving like a robot.

324
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,135
So, because I had started so early,

325
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,971
by the time it became
more mainstream fashion,

326
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,556
me and a few other guys,

327
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,809
we had become quite good
at what we're doing.

328
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,440
We danced in shopping malls,

329
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,609
clubs, and discotheques.

330
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,446
But at the end of the day,
it gave me a lot of self-confidence

331
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,116
and it taught me a lot
about physicality and space.

332
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,996
Dancing totally had
a significant impact on me.

333
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:54,211
I've become very interested
in movements and geometry.

334
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm just...
I'm just working with this mirror here.

335
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:03,720
And it's so nice. It's a round mirror
and it looks like a tunnel, right?

336
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,096
So...

337
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,140
So, check this out. So, when I do...

338
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:13,188
Do you see? And now I'll show you.
It's a slow mirror. I'm just going to...

339
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,564
Hang on. Hang on.

340
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,903
Do you see? So, the...
the time sequence...

341
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,655
can be off.

342
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,322
Here's on.

343
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,578
And here's off.

344
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,789
So, I like... I like the fact that...

345
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,582
Oh, let me try again.

346
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,960
That I can slow things down
in the mirror.

347
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,548
But obviously, the truth is that...

348
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,009
it's actually not a round mirror.

349
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,887
It's an ellipse mirror,
and it's an experiment, like,

350
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,139
with anamorphic shapes.

351
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,016
Like, if you look at an ellipse...

352
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,309
like this,

353
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,644
from a certain angle,

354
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,314
it appears to be circular.

355
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,275
This has been used very often,
and I'm very interested.

356
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,319
This is what
I've been experimenting with.

357
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,827
I'm very much interested in ideas
about space and structure.

358
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,167
There's always a mix
between nature and design.

359
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,299
I got interested in people
like Buckminster Fuller.

360
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,594
His geodesic dome has proved
the most efficient means

361
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,804
of enclosing space yet devised.

362
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,474
And I came across, in Iceland,

363
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,809
a guy who actually had known
Buckminster Fuller.

364
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,770
His name was Einar Thorsteinn.

365
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,982
And I wanted to do a sculpture
that was inspired by Buckminster Fuller.

366
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,278
And Einar said, "Oh, I know
the mathematical formula for it."

367
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,449
He came and worked here
for 15 years in the studio.

368
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,453
So, that's how I got started working

369
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,205
with scientists and architects.

370
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,917
And in that way,
it just grew very gradually,

371
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,710
a little bit like my career.

372
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,237
Just like with the natural phenomena,

373
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,888
my interest in geometry was also
about experiencing the world.

374
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,310
So, in the studio...

375
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,146
we work so much with geometry and...

376
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:23,235
a number of spatial systems
derived from nature.

377
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,321
This is one of them, for instance.
This is basalt columns.

378
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,491
This... This basalt rock actually comes

379
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,535
from having a volcano
underneath a glacier,

380
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,746
so the rapid cooling
sort of crystallizes the rock.

381
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,543
When I was first invited to participate

382
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,212
in designing or shaping Harpa,

383
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,841
which is the conference
and concert hall in... in Reykjavík...

384
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,095
the people involved
wanted a reference to Iceland.

385
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,892
We in the studio were working
with geometry and nature and packing.

386
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,104
And obviously, these basalt rocks
and how they crystallize

387
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,817
is a very great way of showing
how nature organizes space.

388
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,990
Einar Thorsteinn did some amazing research
on five-fold symmetry.

389
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,659
But more importantly,
we also then developed it

390
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,036
into an architectural structural shape.

391
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,292
We built a space frame.

392
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,462
They're very stiff, they're very strong.

393
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,465
And essentially,
we used very little material

394
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,633
to create a very strong facade,

395
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,719
which holds up the roof, for instance.

396
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,598
The shaping of the building was actually

397
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,184
to kind of amplify
the ephemeral qualities.

398
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,061
The reason why tilting the facade,

399
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,771
just like... over,

400
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,940
is because when the winter light comes,

401
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,485
it...
it works like a mirror and it just...

402
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:50,322
brings the sun onto this area here
in the front, just a little bit.

403
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,619
And the ceiling brings light
into the space,

404
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,413
bounces the light back onto the floor.

405
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,542
And the idea was
that you could sort of activate

406
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,421
the view from the outside
and make the building seem more alive.

407
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,927
We used something
which started in mathematics,

408
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:15,180
became about nature,
which then became about engineering,

409
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:19,017
which then became about a skin
for a concert and conference house.

410
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,354
So, it was an amazing process.

411
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:30,195
So, after Harpa, I said,
"Let's make an architectural company."

412
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,034
- Is this also steel?
- Yes. And everything is open,

413
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,662
everything is exposed to rain and water,

414
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,289
so it's actually like parts of ships.

415
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,124
That's so cool. I love it.

416
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,628
There's actually the studio
in the studio.

417
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:56,471
So, architecture has become a part
of what we do.

418
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,100
And the building we just recently opened
in Denmark

419
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,518
is called Fjordenhus,

420
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,687
because it's a... it's a hus,
it's a house,

421
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,105
that stands in the fjord.

422
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,944
It's a building that looks complex,

423
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,863
but, actually, how it's built up
is very simple.

424
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,574
So, this model here,

425
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:19,828
the skin is actually penetrated
by this negative volume here.

426
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,289
So, you see, this one fits in here...

427
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,083
and on this side here.

428
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,543
And that organizes, then,

429
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,296
these kind of parabolic openings,

430
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,548
and these kind of spaces are then used

431
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,718
whether as balconies,
as open spaces, or as offices.

432
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,514
If you take a picture
of a curved wall,

433
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,016
it kind of becomes flat.

434
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,186
But if you move, the curved wall
changes perspective a lot,

435
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,648
and everything becomes explicit.

436
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:04,331
I think the overlap between art
and architecture can make both better.

437
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,045
These are the technical drawings
for the LA gallery show.

438
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,131
So, we don't mind
having a mirror here on the wall,

439
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,841
and then, it ends with the...

440
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,011
Yeah, but maybe we just move it...
Now we just move it over a little bit.

441
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,679
Yeah. So, let's put the work...

442
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:20,971
in the middle.

443
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,601
Let's try it. This one we might not need,

444
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,437
because it's just much nicer,
the compass in this space alone,

445
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,688
and then this and this.

446
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,607
Okay, great. So, that's it then.

447
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,361
I'll just grab my pen.

448
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,698
I was always interested in perception.

449
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,788
There's plenty of examples,
like, historically speaking,

450
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,374
of how we choose to use our eyes.

451
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,378
The first mirrors in the world

452
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,213
were made of black obsidian.

453
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,215
Then people would go through the parks,

454
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,051
and in the mirror,
they would see the back.

455
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,430
You have the future in front of you,
but if you hold up a little mirror,

456
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,558
you can see where you came from,
you can see the past.

457
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,605
When I was a younger artist,

458
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,108
I'm still relatively young, right?

459
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,693
But when I was a younger artist,

460
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,987
I moved from Denmark to Germany.

461
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:23,702
And I wouldn't say I was easygoing,
because I literally gave up everything...

462
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,496
to pursue what I wanted to do.

463
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,253
Though the new year
began here in the two Germanys

464
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:37,048
with these remarkable sights,
unthinkable such a short time ago.

465
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,593
It was in '89...

466
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,388
The sledge...
when it went up.

467
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,390
The Berlin Wall came down.

468
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,686
Even the East Germans
seemed exhilarated...

469
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:53,523
Me and a fellow student,
we rented a car and we drove to Berlin.

470
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:03,283
And suddenly, you just see
all these people from East coming through.

471
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,880
It was very touching.

472
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,979
I mean, it was difficult to understand...

473
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,970
to be honest, the scope
of what we were actually seeing.

474
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:33,021
How do I make what is abstract tangible?

475
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,317
It's the process
of narrowing it down to the bone.

476
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,697
But when I moved to Germany,

477
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,618
I thought I was going out into the world
to be an artist like everybody else.

478
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,244
But they were so good,

479
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,913
and I was like, "Oh...

480
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,873
I'm never gonna make it."

481
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,376
I said, "If I'm gonna somehow
say something,

482
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,212
I better be myself."

483
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:12,268
I wanted to hand over the responsibility
for experiencing the artwork

484
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,812
to the participant.

485
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,155
A reality projector is a very large space

486
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,990
and has a kind of balcony you enter here.

487
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,159
So, this is a person in the space, right?

488
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,371
And in the space,
the ceiling was these enormous,

489
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,331
uh, triangulated trusses.

490
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,044
So, I thought, "Maybe it would be possible

491
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,589
to expose the structure
that holds up the ceiling."

492
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,969
We started putting up lamps up here.

493
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,096
And then you would have a shadow,

494
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:52,183
which essentially is the beam
from the ceiling.

495
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,395
And it would move if we move the light.

496
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,771
So that was kind of nice.

497
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,691
And if we'd have two lights
that moved in different directions,

498
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,360
the shadows moved...
Suddenly, there was kind of a movie.

499
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:10,535
His temptation
to integrate the architecture,

500
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,830
I think is a very intelligent approach

501
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,291
and maximizes the possibility.

502
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,799
You see, don't forget
this is a person here, right?

503
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,468
Hello. This is a little person.

504
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,138
So, this was enormous.

505
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,015
It was very abstract.

506
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,104
There's something very dreamy
to see huge shadows moving.

507
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,609
Something very sort of meditative.

508
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,447
And I thought maybe we should add sound.

509
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,545
My artist friend Yanchi
recorded the delivery of a piano

510
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,423
and the sound
of the construction of a piano.

511
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,387
Some people saw...

512
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,890
city cranes, a harbor,

513
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,558
modern systems.

514
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,562
And some people saw abstract paintings,
and color films,

515
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,731
and more like psychedelic sort of stuff.

516
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,447
Underneath this idea
of empowering the spectator,

517
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,158
there is something
which is very fundamental.

518
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,872
Museums make huge explanations
to make sure that people get it,

519
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,375
but you sometimes end up
with a feeling where,

520
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,379
"I must be really stupid since
they have to over-explain everything."

521
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:50,385
So, when I say the viewer of a work of art

522
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,721
is smart enough
to co-produce the narrative,

523
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:57,684
it gives the viewer the sense of saying,
"I'm actually good enough."

524
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,152
When I was small,
I very much liked to draw.

525
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,574
And my father would typically just

526
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,911
tell me to do some doodles
on the paper, just like kind of...

527
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,747
you know, like, just like swing
the pen around on the paper

528
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,166
and then just fill out the fields.

529
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,295
Of course, it'd just be abstract.
It's just an abstract drawing.

530
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,050
So, the exercise
is actually the imagination,

531
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,301
or the, you know, fantasy,

532
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,679
and to sort of see things
that are invisible.

533
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,306
So, let me just show you the cat here.

534
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,017
There's an eye here.

535
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,020
There's another eye here.

536
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,356
Maybe this is, you know, the cat nose.

537
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,191
Kind of the other way around.

538
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
That's fine.

539
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,737
Then we have... I can put in...

540
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:55,324
Ah, there's an ear here,
there's another ear here, yeah?

541
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,619
So, see? So, gradually, my cat...

542
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,747
has a kind of a leonine.

543
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,419
When I talk to kids about, you know,
"Can you draw a car or something?”

544
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,630
I really try to emphasize
it's not really about the car.

545
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,007
It's more about, "You have...

546
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,509
Do you have the fantasy
to actually see the car?"

547
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,886
Let's go on.

548
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,683
Cheers. It's just that I didn't do that
since I was a child.

549
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,773
So, as my studio evolved,

550
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,401
I also started working more
with advocacy groups.

551
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,988
And the studio today actually is...
is a kind of a mix

552
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,199
between the normal artwork,

553
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,160
but we're also involved
with the politics somehow.

554
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,330
Turning thinking into doing.

555
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,878
So, I thought I should see

556
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,131
if what I have learned in art
could be applied onto, for instance,

557
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,841
a kind of a more sort of, um...

558
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,259
advocacy project.

559
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,179
And this is how the project Ice Watch
came along.

560
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,645
How do we make the climate explicit

561
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,106
and turn thinking into doing?

562
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,860
And the Ice Watch project
is very straightforward.

563
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,780
It's glacial ice from Greenland,

564
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,407
from the glacier that is disappearing,

565
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,825
put on the street.

566
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,798
People walk up to it and...

567
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,925
see it, listen to it, touch it.

568
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,846
This is what is melting and disappearing,

569
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,889
and it was melting right then.
Then, of course...

570
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,517
this is what we're talking about.

571
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,481
Then they would put their hand on it
and they go,

572
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,774
"It's cold."

573
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,862
And of course everybody knows ice is cold
because it's ice, right?

574
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,615
But behavioral change
is much more emotional.

575
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,329
It's so simple...

576
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,000
but that simplicity is deceptive.

577
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:13,337
Because it's going to disappear,
and you know it's gonna disappear.

578
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,008
That he could create
something so beautiful

579
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,926
that would conjure
that unthinkable thought

580
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,387
is the mark of a truly great artist.

581
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,644
This is such a great view
down here.

582
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,937
Oh, yeah.

583
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,358
It is.

584
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,988
When I was here half a life ago,

585
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,615
there was, um,

586
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,200
you know, ice coming down,

587
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,912
moving down this water here,
as I remember it. Yeah.

588
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,164
- It... It broke off?
- Yes, yes, yes.

589
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,750
- It did. But there is still beauty.
- Yeah. Yeah.

590
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:54,545
You know, we look at this,
and I think the acknowledgment of that

591
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,633
is important
to keep prosperous and hopeful.

592
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,550
Yeah.

593
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,010
That piece of ice...

594
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,595
- Maybe we can grab that.
- Yeah.

595
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,223
- Let's try it. Yeah.
- Let's see if we can grab that ice.

596
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,977
We saved it.

597
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,063
So...

598
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,065
Now we just need a freezer.

599
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,859
- Yeah, a big one.
- So...

600
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,819
- That's a nice work of art.
- It is.

601
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,322
- Or a nice poem, for that matter.
- Yeah.

602
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,907
Yeah.

603
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,993
- So, are these bubbles?
- Yeah.

604
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,746
So, the air in the bubble,
when it comes out,

605
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,123
it's the air from 5,000 years ago.

606
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,501
I mean, what is beautiful
is that as it actually melts...

607
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,794
- Yeah.
- It kind of pops.

608
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:35,711
Yeah.

609
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,589
So, if we would be very quiet
and sit and wait a little bit,

610
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,758
the ice would start speaking to us.

611
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,385
It would pop like popcorn.

612
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,180
So, it's not, like, disappearing,
it's actually arriving.

613
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,432
It's about being... being present.

614
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,814
If we want to change something about
the climate, it needs to be made explicit,

615
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,232
it needs to be physical.

616
00:37:56,315 --> 00:38:00,194
And this is what culture is, right?
Culture is, to a large extent, physical.

617
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,406
It's... It's...
It's stuff out in the world.

618
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,662
I have worked so much with light.

619
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,708
Light is so fundamental
to everything, right?

620
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,880
As I also started traveling,
I realized that...

621
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,967
every eighth person in the world

622
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,720
does not have access to energy.
Like, to light.

623
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,057
So, this is actually the little sun.

624
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,477
And there's a solar panel here
on the back, so...

625
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,145
when I hold it up like that,
I'm actually charging,

626
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,898
then I have light for the whole evening.

627
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,985
Now, I have sustainable energy
right here in the palm of my hand,

628
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,738
and I... I call that
holding hands with the sun.

629
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,993
It's about the right
to have access to light.

630
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,620
No one will ever have to sit in darkness.

631
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,752
We sell this at a higher price,
knowing museum stores are online.

632
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:02,798
And the profit from that
is then driving lamps into off-grid areas.

633
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,343
In those areas,

634
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,554
you would normally buy
100 milliliters of kerosene a week.

635
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:11,682
That is money which was then spent
on something else.

636
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:15,227
It went into the economy. It didn't go out
and into the oil industry.

637
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,947
It's important to talk about the climate

638
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,284
in a language that is not always
about doom and gloom.

639
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:34,246
It's very important to design things
that has a positive narrative.

640
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:42,463
You can turn thinking into doing. You can.

641
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,947
The gallery that I work with has opened up
a space here in Los Angeles and...

642
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,167
it's exciting for me because this is
my first show here in this space

643
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,160
and the first time I show these works.

644
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,459
I love it.

645
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,379
This has turned out amazing.

646
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:27,383
Somehow, I don't remember
it looking like this in the studio.

647
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,100
It's good to make art with mirrors,
so I can check my hair.

648
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,792
Art is the world's ability

649
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:06,172
to investigate and have
an intimate relationship with itself.

650
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:12,470
Gerhard Richter, the German painter, said,
"Art is the highest form of hope."

651
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:20,394
At the bottom of my heart,
I love making art.

652
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,947
So, why are you watching this episode?

653
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,741
I mean, I'm very happy you are,

654
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,702
but it's also important
that you think about yourself, right?

655
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,287
What is in it for you?

656
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,081
What are you actually doing here?

657
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:46,128
It's about the ability to see something.

658
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:54,094
It's incredibly important that we do not
take our surroundings for granted.

659
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:59,141
To realize I can see more,
should I make the effort.

660
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,230
For instance,

661
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,690
depending on where you are in the world,

662
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,276
the quality of the daylight
is very different.

663
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,322
This is how the light looks in Berlin.

664
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,285
So, this is the amazing light
here in Los Angeles.

665
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,539
It's, of course, very famous,
just like the traffic is.

666
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,499
We're standing on the street...

667
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,662
in front of the gallery.

668
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,798
This is the color of the daylight
here in Iceland,

669
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,758
right... right outside of my studio.

670
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,261
Even what we take for granted, such as,

671
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,346
"Oh, this is just sunlight,"

672
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,806
is actually very different.

673
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,129
Once you see that reality
is actually relative...

674
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,300
it is more likely to also change.

675
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,929
So, north is exactly over there.

676
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,099
Berlin, where my studio is...

677
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:23,684
Right?

678
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,644
Is there.

679
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,357
So, we are not lost after all.
