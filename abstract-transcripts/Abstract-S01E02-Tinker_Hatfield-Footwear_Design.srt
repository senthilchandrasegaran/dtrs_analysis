embedded inside of a sneaker.

163
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:54,819
And I'm kind of moving through
from that first page of space.

164
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,284
Now I'm getting more specific
about innovation in general.

165
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,537
I remember
somebody telling me it'd be great

166
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,459
if Nike could do shoes that were invisible
and I drew the Invisible Man.

167
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,920
This is just all stuff
that's coming to my head

168
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,131
and I'm just sketching.

169
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,800
All of this stuff ended up
in a drawing of a shoe.

170
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,381
A stream of consciousness
can lead you some place.

171
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,216
You may not even know
where you're headed,

172
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:21,142
but somehow you end up somewhere,
and here I ended up with a shoe.

00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,889
[TV commercial announcer]
<i>Today at Nike, we know even more.</i>

174
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:29,857
<i>We developed one of the most sophisticated</i>
<i>sport research labs in the world.</i>

175
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,149
[Parker] <i>Nike had grown up very fast.</i>

176
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,613
We were leading the industry,

177
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,824
<i>focused on basketball and running.</i>

<i>Reebok came along,</i>
<i>there was this aerobics craze.</i>

180
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:46,463
[Tinker] <i>Reebok invented aerobics shoes.</i>
<i>It was a whole new thing.</i>

181
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,669
<i>They had the right product</i>
<i>at the right time,</i>

182
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,840
and they actually passed Nike in size.

183
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,973
<i>So there was a bit of a panic and Nike</i>
<i>was laying people off right and left.</i>

184
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,010
<i>They were also thinking that they needed</i>
<i>to upgrade their design group.</i>

185
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:04,064
<i>So, I was invited to be a part</i>
<i>of a 24-hour design contest.</i>

186
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,270
[bike revs]

187
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,351
[Parker]<i> Tinker wasn't</i>
<i>a shoe designer at the time.</i>

188
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,316
He was designing trade shows
and displays and retail.

189
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,654
[Tinker]<i> I worked the whole 24 hours.</i>
<i>I didn't go to bed that night.</i>

190
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,816
<i>Most of the other designers,</i>

191
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,914
<i>I think, just tried to work off of</i>
<i>what they were already doing,</i>

192
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,120
<i>and it wasn't really anything very unique</i>
<i>in terms of storytelling.</i>

193
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,158
<i>I came back in with a big presentation,</i>

194
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,877
<i>sort of having fun with the fact</i>
<i>that this was the perfect shoe</i>

[laughs]

197
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,589
<i>And then get out and then jog around</i>
<i>and walk around a little bit.</i>

198
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,800
Two days after the competition,

199
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,724
I was... I wasn't even asked,

200
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:47,064
I was <i>told</i> that I was now
a footwear designer for Nike. [chuckles]

201
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,770
<i>In a very short period of time,</i>
<i>I pretty much became the lead designer.</i>

202
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,984
[guitar music playing]

203
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,613
<i>One of my very first projects</i>
<i>was the Air Max.</i>

204
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:00,573
<i>I felt like this was an opportunity</i>
<i>to think way differently.</i>

205
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:05,242
<i>Nike was encapsulating gas</i>
<i>inside a urethane airbag</i>

206
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,906
<i>for a cushioning component.</i>

207
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,290
<i>I thought, "Let's make the bag</i>
<i>a little bit wider, make sure it's stable,</i>

208
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,754
<i>but then let's remove part of the midsole,</i>
<i>so we actually see it."</i>

209
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,256
The closest you'd come to anything
before that was, I remember as a kid,

210
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:26,311
seeing Elton John having high-heeled shoes
with a goldfish inside of them.

211
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,179
Right? I mean, it was simply, like,
very... punk even.

212
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,097
[Tinker] <i>I had gone to Paris</i>

213
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:37,226
<i>and seen a very controversial and loved</i>
<i>or mostly hated building,</i>

214
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,857
<i>The Georges Pompidou Center,</i>
<i>designed by Renzo Piano.</i>

215
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:46,738
<i>It was a building with all of the inside</i>
<i>mechanics on the outside of the building.</i>

216
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:51,615
<i>He painted everything in primary colors</i>
<i>just to piss off people even more.</i>

217
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,132
<i>I was very much inspired by that building,</i>

218
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,879
<i>and that's how I ended up</i>
<i>exposing these airbags in the Air Max.</i>

219
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,086
After those sketches came out,

220
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:06,595
it was widely discussed
that I had pushed it too far.

221
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,425
<i>People were trying to get us fired,</i>

222
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,055

<i>like there was no way in the world</i>

223
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,063
<i>that we could ever sell a shoe</i>
<i>with an exposed airbag</i>

224
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,607

225
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,687
<i>The Air Max One took off.</i>

226
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,777
<i>It was an amazing success story</i>

227
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,372

<i>but for all of footwear design.</i>

228

<i>It's built on taking a risk</i>
<i>for a good reason,</i>

<i>which was to tell a story</i>
<i>and to also make a better product.</i>

[funky music playing]

231
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,894
<i>At the same time</i>
<i>that the Air Max came out,</i>

232
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,719
<i>I realized that nobody</i>
<i>was in the right shoe most of the time.</i>

233
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,637
<i>Everybody was trying to play basketball</i>

<i>or trying to run in basketball shoes,</i>

235

<i>and you would see people getting hurt,</i>
<i>rolling their ankles.</i>

236
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:04,780
<i>I thought we needed to design a shoe,</i>
<i>and that became their first cross-trainer.</i>

237
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,700
<i>It needed some lateral stability.</i>

238
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,159
<i>There was a mid-foot strap</i>
<i>to strap down that part of your foot,</i>

239
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,124
<i>so then you could participate</i>

<i>and not have to change your shoes.</i>

241

<i>We didn't think</i>
<i>that it was going to sell all that well,</i>

249
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,187
<i>Then you had this push</i>
<i>from the advertising side,</i>

250
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,403
<i>it was all about promoting</i>
<i>the Air Max and the Air Trainer.</i>

251
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,952
<i>We had broken through</i>
<i>some sort of paradigm</i>

252

<i>in how athletic footwear was designed.</i>

253
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,243
<i>I remember talking to my wife after that,</i>

254
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,946

257
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:12,313
<i>In a lot of ways, design is about</i>

258

<i>In 1987, I was asked to get involved</i>
<i>in the </i>Back to the Future<i> series.</i>

260
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,692
[futuristic music playing]

261
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:31,196
<i>They really needed a special shoe design</i>
<i>that would fit into the year 2015,</i>

262
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,952
<i>which was 25 years in the future.</i>

263
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:38,292
This is the early storyboards
for the <i>Back to the Future II </i>movie<i>.</i>

264
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,499
<i>They were talking about</i>
<i>magnetic levitation.</i>

265
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:46,085
<i>"He can stand on the ceiling</i>
<i>or walk up a wall."</i>

00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,132
<i>It's an old joke. It's an old gag.</i>

267
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,138
<i>I felt like</i>
<i>it shouldn't really be a gag at all.</i>

268

<i>excite people about the future.</i>

269

<i>I just felt like maybe something</i>
<i>that would happen in the future...</i>

270
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:04,524
Shoes would be smart
and could sense who you were

271
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:08,647
and when you put it on,
it comes alive and shapes to your foot.

272
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,572
It's your shoe. The shoe knows you.

<i>to do the </i>Back to the Future<i> shoe.</i>

278
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,423
And finally in 2006,
I went to Mark Parker and I said,

279
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,763
"You know, why don't we go ahead
and try and make one of these things?

280
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,760
You know,
a replica of that old movie shoe."

281
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,272
The shoe that was on the set
was actually a dummy shoe,

282
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:40,018
in the sense that
it wasn't actually working.

283
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:43,981
There was a prop person
who pulled the laces down tight on the set

284
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,153
to make it look like
it was a real working shoe.

285
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,686
But we were always intrigued with,
you know,

286
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,147
actually making a sample that worked.

287
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,740

try-on-able <i>Back to the Future </i>shoe

289
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,328
This was from 2007, and back then...

290
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,424
[Tinker] The motor was--

291
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,378

as small as it is today.

It was either that
or the old car battery in the backpack.

295
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:14,005
It took a solid year and a half
of just trial and error, trial and error.

296
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,723
And so we'll run this.

298
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,983
I was very proud that we got this far.

299
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,059
I thought, "Oh,
this is going to be amazing."

300
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:27,605
But we had to wait
for some technology to advance.

301
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,190
So motors had to get a little smaller,
faster, stronger.

302
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,162
We actually put it on pause
for a little while there.

303
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,358
[Tinker] It was great to see

304
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,448
that Tiffany and her team
could get a shoe to do just that,

305
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,825
but clearly it was a long way away
from looking exactly like the movie shoe.

319
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,111
<i>I think he was 19 maybe,</i>
<i>and I hadn't heard of him.</i>

320
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:56,395
<i>I went to Las Vegas,</i>
<i>and I spent some time with him.</i>

321
00:19:56,487 --> 00:20:01,077
He had long hair, kind of,
basically like a long mullet.

322
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,124
<i>He was just very youthful and young</i>

323
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,543
<i>and just not like any tennis player</i>
<i>I'd ever worked with.</i>

324
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:12,133
Everything in tennis at that time
was kind of the same and boring.

325
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,801
[Tinker] <i>It was a new kind of</i>
<i>style of tennis, which was basically</i>

326
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,220
<i>just get at the baseline</i>
<i>and just hit the ball hard as you can.</i>

327
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:23,763
<i>I really started to explore</i>
<i>the fact that this young tennis player</i>

328
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:28,268
<i>did not grow up going to country clubs.</i>
<i>He did not grow up wearing white.</i>

329
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,691
<i>So I'm like,</i>
<i>"Man, this is so unlike tennis."</i>

330
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,732
He not only designed the shoes,

331
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:37,186
<i>which were quite outrageous,</i>
<i>they were kind of hot pink,</i>

332
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,698
and the outfit was wild.

333
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,532
[Tinker]<i> So we drew Andre wearing</i>
<i>that denim short with a Lycra under-short.</i>

334
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,162
Absolutely meant to be anti-tennis.

335
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,134
I coined the phrase "anti-country club,"

336
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,788
<i>because it's not always</i>
<i>just about the shoe design.</i>

337
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,923
<i>If you have an athlete</i>
<i>with the right personality,</i>

338
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,296

both of Michael's parents.

367
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,854
But ultimately Michael shows up,

368

<i>"Well, what do you got?"</i>

370

and just said, "Well, thanks for coming.

show me the shoe, you know?

375
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,667
He storytells and then he draws

376
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:03,303
and then, you know, he shows me
all the pictures of it,

377
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:07,262
and I still can't visualize it
until you put it in my hand.

378
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:11,894
I pulled the shroud off the shoe,
and there it was right in front of him.

Phil Knight's sitting on pins and needles,
his parents are over there.

380
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:19,902
He looks at the shoe, looks at me
and he goes, "Tell me more."

381
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,362
I said, "Remember we talked
about how you wanted a midcut,

382
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:25,453
<i>and no one had ever done a midcut height</i>
<i>for a basketball shoe?</i>

383
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,159
<i>It's just what you wanted.</i>

384
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,449
Remember we talked about
how the shoe should already feel

385
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,004
like they're broken-in and perfect to wear

386
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,498
when they're brand-new,
right out of the box?

387
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,370
<i>This shoe is made out</i>
<i>of really soft leather,</i>

388
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,088
so it's reinforced in the right places,
but when you put this on,

389
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,709
it's gonna be like glove leather,
and it's just gonna fit great.

390
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,586
<i>And then remember picking</i>
<i>some new materials</i>

391
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,804
<i>that no one had ever seen</i>
<i>on a basketball shoe before?</i>

392
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,345
<i>And so that elephant print."</i>

393
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:54,181
When he told me about the leather itself
and the elephant print,

394
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,556
things of that nature,

395
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,233
you know, he kind of won me over.

396
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,811
I said, "But wait! There's more!"

00:23:58,896 --> 00:23:59,726
[laughs]

398
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,403
And I had, without him even knowing it,

399
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:05,362
I had designed an entire collection
of apparel to go with that shoe.

400

<i>That was a rush.</i>

410
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:35,814
I think, to this day, Phil Knight
actually really thinks I helped save Nike.

411
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,443
<i>We had to wait several years</i>

412
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,565
<i>for technology to catch up</i>
<i>to our </i>Back to the Future <i>shoe.</i>

413
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:53,280
<i>In that time, my ultimate goal shifted</i>
<i>to applying it to athletic footwear.</i>

414
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:57,044
<i>So we dual-purposed</i>
<i>the auto-lacing technology,</i>

415
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,831
<i>and that became E.A.R.L..</i>

416
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,960
There are many drawings.

417
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:09,933
Some of them look a bit like hiking boots,
some look like basketball shoes.

418
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,179
[Beers] <i>Once we started getting</i>
<i>the sketches from Tinker,</i>

419
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,432
<i>we knew what the direction</i>
<i>and the focus was.</i>

420
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:20,394
We literally took the Jordan 28,
and it had a carved-out area underfoot

421
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,057
and we hid the motor under there.

422
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:26,276
<i>Some of these shoes failed,</i>
<i>some came apart, some broke.</i>

423
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,238
<i>And so we explained all of our problems</i>
<i>to Tinker, and he redesigned it for us.</i>

424
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,408
[Tinker] <i>While we're trying to solve</i>

425
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,449
<i>these problems that Tiffany is finding out</i>
<i>through our wear testing,</i>

426
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,701
<i>I'm now trying to help</i>
<i>refine that process.</i>

427
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,084
[Beers] <i>After we got</i>
<i>the mechanism into here,</i>

428
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,285
<i>we found out that our mechanism</i>
<i>was pretty robust.</i>

429
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,995
Then Mark asked, "Let's put it
in the <i>Back to the Future </i>shoe."

430
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,968
And that's how we get around
to auto-lacing in the MAG.

[Garcia] <i>Here in New York,</i>
<i>where I was raised,</i>

446
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,257
<i>this is the Mecca for sneaker culture.</i>

447
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,010
There were a lot of people in New York
who wore sneakers,

448
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,846
but they basically wanted to wear
what everyone was wearing.

449
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:43,522
<i>Me and my crew, we wanted to wear</i>
<i>what no one else was wearing.</i>

450
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:48,436
<i>We were like this early group</i>
<i>of tastemakers determining what was cool.</i>

451
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,527
When the Jordan 1 came out,
we thought it was whack.

452
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,661
<i>Initially, like, corny people wore them.</i>

453
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,739
And the 2 came out. The 2 was, like,
okay, it's an improvement.

454
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:03,536
Really, like, Tinker Hatfield
saved that whole... scheme,

455
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,832
'cause when he came in
and brought his design to it,

456
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,417
and then Jordan kept on
becoming a better ballplayer,

457
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:14,383
<i>Jordan had the ability to draw</i>
<i>people's attention beyond the nucleus</i>

458
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,136
<i>of the ballplayer community.</i>

459
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:22,217
Tinker had a way of somehow
grasping that ethos...

460
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,597
and combining it
with the greatness of Jordan...

461
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,096
and fusing that into a sneaker,

462
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,817
so that by the Jordan 3, 4, 5 and beyond,

463
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,478
<i>the Jordan brand becomes larger than life.</i>

[upbeat music playing]

465
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,163
Practically every time we built a shoe,
it was an improvement.

466
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,660
I felt like it was time
to sort of zig a little bit,

467
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,912
<i>and Michael was like,</i>
<i>"Yeah, baby. Let's do it."</i>

468
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:46,575
I never wanted heavy shoes.
I always wanted to feel light on my feet.

[Tinker] <i>Michael wants it</i>
<i>to be breathable. I do too.</i>

00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:01,806
<i>He was kind of floating</i>
<i>around the edges of the game</i>

475
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,889
<i>like a fighter pilot</i>
<i>in a World War II movie.</i>

476
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,392
[gunfire]

477
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,268
<i>They used to put nose art</i>
<i>on World War II fighter planes.</i>

478
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,863
<i>So I put flames on the side of this shoe.</i>

479
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,952
<i>I drew them backwards because</i>
<i>we were always fighting convention.</i>

480
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,779
[Jordan] <i>I want to be different,</i>

481
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,624
but there have been times
when he's been way different.

482
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,290
And I'd say, "Nah, that's not me.
You got to come back a bit."

483
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:28,285
[Tinker]<i> In '91, he won</i>
<i>the first of six championships.</i>

484
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,253
[TV commentator]
<i>Michael Jordan is the unanimous MVP.</i>

485
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:32,955
[Tinker] <i>We're always trying</i>
<i>to solve problems</i>

486
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,915
<i>for the best athletes in the world.</i>

487
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,165
<i>But one of the problems</i>
<i>that you run into in design</i>

488
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,797
<i>is how you're going to make it</i>
<i>newer and different from year to year.</i>

489
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,932
<i>People kept lining up for the shoes.</i>

490
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,854
[TV reporter]
<i>They're already proving popular.</i>

491
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,143
[Tinker] <i>And Michael</i>
<i>kept winning championships.</i>

[TV commentator] <i>The Bulls win!</i>

493
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:53,015
[Jordan] <i>I wear out the right forefoot</i>
<i>or the left forefoot</i>

494
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,436
<i>because of my turning,</i>
<i>because of my agility.</i>

495

[Tinker] <i>He's 6'6", 210 pounds.</i>

496
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,948
<i>You have to really make sure</i>
<i>that these shoes don't roll over.</i>

497
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:04,871
I came up with these fingers
that help hold his foot on the platform.

498
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,833
[Jordan] <i>The 10 was one of the shoes</i>
<i>when I retired the first time.</i>

499
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,294
I was playing baseball.

500
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:11,884
It's time to ride something else.

501
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,842
I was bound and determined
to keep the line going.

502
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:20,591
<i>I commemorated his ten years as a pro</i>
<i>with these ten stripes.</i>

503
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,718
[Jordan] <i>I wanted</i>
<i>that lifestyle basketball shoe,</i>

504
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:26,014
where you still play the game
with that shoe,

505
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,638
but then at the end of the day,
you can wear it, you know, with a tuxedo.

506
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,560
[Tinker] <i>We sourced</i>
<i>this really high-quality patent leather.</i>

507
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:38,069
<i>A few months later, I pull it out of a bag</i>
<i>in a hotel room and show it to him.</i>

508
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,991
He basically says
"Holy shit, that's amazing."

509
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,280
<i>Several months later, he un-retires.</i>

510
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,040
I said, "Don't wear 'em in a game,

511
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,249
because we don't... They're not ready
to go to market or anything."

512
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,001
[TV reporter] <i>Today he will sport</i>
<i>a brand-new pair of shoes.</i>

513
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,754
<i>They're a black patent leather.</i>
<i>They are very stylish...</i>

514
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,257
I just about fell out my chair,
I'm like, "Oh, God. Jeez."

515
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,549
He thought one way, I thought another.

516
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,513
And lo and behold, I won.
[chuckles softly]

517
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,138
[Tinker] <i>You can be inspired</i>
<i>by all kinds of things,</i>

518
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,443
<i>but maybe the most reliable inspiration</i>
<i>is just Michael.</i>

519
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:15,188
<i>He reminded me</i>
<i>of a powerful predatory cat.</i>

520
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,402
<i>I just call it the Black Cat.</i>

521
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,652
And he goes, "How did you know that?"
And I said, "Know what?"

522
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,283
He goes, "How did you know...

523
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:28,873
that only my very best and closest friends
have always called me Black Cat."

524
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:32,162
<i>We were becoming close enough</i>
<i>over these years</i>

525
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,957
<i>that I could communicate with him</i>
<i>on a different level.</i>

526
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,710
<i>We're going through</i>
<i>working on Air Jordans,</i>

527
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,424
<i>and you have to, again,</i>
<i>top yourself each year.</i>

528
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:45,138
<i>That, to me, is pressure that's healthy.</i>
<i>You need it in order to push yourself.</i>

529
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,845
<i>But on top of all that</i>
<i>was just pure exhaustion.</i>

530
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:54,557
<i>Just working and traveling</i>
<i>and the hundred-hour weeks</i>

531
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:58,614
<i>and the missing of children's birthdays</i>
<i>and holidays.</i>

532
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,534
<i>My kids were getting older</i>

533
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:04,609
<i>and I desperately wanted to spend</i>
<i>more time with them, and my wife too,</i>

534
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,446
<i>and they were really patient.</i>

535
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:10,951
<i>Right around about the 15th Air Jordan,</i>
<i>I was feeling the effects of that.</i>

536
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,794
[director]<i> The 15 was really</i>
<i>the first Jordan</i>

537
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,166
<i>that had negative reviews.</i>

538
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,417
Was this shoe
somehow a turning point for you?

539
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:28,514
So, I think this was all about
maybe, uh, designing a shoe

540
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:33,095
that maybe it wasn't gonna be, uh,
loved by everyone,

541
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,853
but it certainly made a statement.

542
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:40,186
And there were a lot of things
going on in my life at that time.

543
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,323
I was very, very saddened
by the passing of Bill Bowerman.

544
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,412
My father had passed away
three years before.

545
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:50,452
And Michael's father had passed away
a few years before, and...

546
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,954
[sighs] you know, a few years back,
and... [stammers]

547
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:59,875
Just a lot. Yeah, it was a lot going on,
and I was ready to be done.

548
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:05,467
<i>I was trying to extricate myself</i>
<i>from designing any more Air Jordans.</i>

549
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:09,933
<i>I was tired. I was kind of worn out,</i>
<i>but also I felt like I'd done enough.</i>

550
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,269
And, um... [clicks tongue]
Bill Bowerman passing away was huge.

551
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,556
[inhales sharply]

552
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,476
[sighs]

553
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,944
[sniffles]

554
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,653
<i>Without the story and the meaning,</i>

555
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,653
<i>you can look at performance</i>
<i>as a driving force,</i>

556
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:31,236
<i>but these shoes are more than that to me</i>
<i>and, I think, to millions of people.</i>

557
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,373
They have meaning and it might be
different for different people,

558
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:40,044
but this one and all the other ones
we've just talked about have...

559
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,835
There's a story with each one.

560
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:46,878
So it's not just scribbling on a piece
of paper and coming up with a design,

561
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:51,385
it's a lot of effort that goes into trying
to be meaningful.

562
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,927
<i>I did think it was the end</i>
<i>of my shoe designing career.</i>

563
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:04,362
<i>After that shoe,</i>
<i>I took myself off the Air Jordan line.</i>

564
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:11,363
Tinker sat in the zone that makes
a lot of people uncomfortable.

565
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:15,832
And I think that excites him,
but it also creates some stress.

566
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,331
Because you have to own a new direction,

567
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:23,383
and you have to help people understand
that this is a better way to go.

568
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,212
And that's a huge task,
and it's a big responsibility.

569
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,473
But that's what drives him.

570
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,469
[upbeat piano music playing]

571
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,471
[Tinker] Good job!

572
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,483
<i>I think that when you're younger,</i>

573
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,823
<i>really you're just trying to,</i>
<i>I think, win.</i>

574
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,947
Get it! Oh, dude...

575
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,159
<i>Reaching for glory.</i>

576
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,739
That one wasn't quite as strong of a jump.

577
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,454
Be aggressive about it.

578
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,955
<i>I like to go and coach young people</i>
<i>because I can pass along what I know.</i>

579
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:05,338
<i>On the surface, you're trying to help kids</i>
<i>go higher in the pole vault.</i>

580
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,288
There you go!

581
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:10,302
<i>But the real purpose is</i>
<i>to help them overcome fear</i>

582
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:14,392
<i>and do something they've never done before</i>
<i>and to develop confidence in themselves.</i>

583
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,679
Take that extra momentum
and do something with it.

584
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,064
Get upside down and make it happen.

585
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,353
<i>Even though I'm not finished,</i>

586
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,765
<i>I'd reached this point</i>
<i>where I could continue to be creative</i>

587
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,395
<i>and design products,</i>

588
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,282
<i>but the next step is to actually be</i>
<i>a mentor and a teacher</i>

589
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,280
<i>and maybe inspire people as well.</i>

590
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,447
Oh, whoa! One went up there.

591
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,368
Gotta have two!

592
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,289
I just happen to know that.

593
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,752
It's just... from experience.

594
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:07,805
<i>In 2005, I came out of Jordan retirement,</i>
<i>and designed the Jordan 20.</i>

595
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:12,189
I asked him to come back
because 20 was somewhat of a special shoe.

596
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,204
[Tinker] <i>I really wanted to,</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>

597
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,830
<i>talk to Michael Jordan about his life</i>
<i>over these past 20 years.</i>

598
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,663
<i>He absolutely did not want to do that.</i>

599
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:24,997
<i>I said, "Come on, man.</i>

600
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,291
For the first time,
let's just look back a little bit

601
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,085
and that will help us go forward, too."

602
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,876
<i>It became less</i>
<i>about me asking questions...</i>

603
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:41,973
and just more about him telling me,
like a stream of consciousness,

604
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,927
stuff that was coming into his head.

605
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,774
And I'm, like, taking notes like crazy.

606
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:53,025
<i>I started to realize</i>
<i>that I could start designing a symbol</i>

607
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,149
<i>that would represent each and every one</i>
<i>of those stories.</i>

608
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,735
There are things in here
that I don't think he ever told anybody.

609
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,199
<i>That became the heart of this shoe.</i>

610
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,658
<i>Some of them are emotional.</i>

611
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,294
<i>And some of them are just funny.</i>

612
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,085
<i>It's really a kind of</i>
<i>an avant-garde approach</i>

613
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,999
<i>to a basketball shoe design.</i>

614
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,678
<i>To me, it's part of what makes it special.</i>
<i>It's really, really out there.</i>

615
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,925
For him to come up with that concept
and then have the consumers connect.

616
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,392
If I had to pick the best
storytelling product we've ever done,

617
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:25,604
it was probably the 20s.

618
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,941
[Tinker] <i>I think it's one</i>
<i>of my favorite shoes</i>

619
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,230
<i>that I've ever worked on,</i>

620
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,323
partly because of
that wonderful experience

621
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:35,529
of finally getting Michael
to open up and give me stories.

622
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,239
[upbeat music playing]

623
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,255
[Tinker] What you're about to see

624
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:03,722
is our very first toe in the water
toward full adaptability.

625
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,265
Just step into the shoe,
it automatically closes.

626
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,929
[Tinker] Who would like to try it on?

627
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,400
When you look at the E.A.R.L., is there
a reason that that shoe should exist?

628
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,324
No.

629
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:23,122
But like any great thing, you create it,
and then people want it.

630
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,369
What we saw for the tech audience,
two cool things.

631
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:26,292
Number one thing:

632
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,789
<i>the first self-lacing shoe</i>
<i>for the consumer.</i>

633
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,753
[reporter] <i>Nike looks to one-up rivals</i>

634
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,383
<i>in an increasingly tech-driven</i>
<i>athletic market.</i>

635
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:37,841
I just want to give you guys
a quick first look at the shoes.

636
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,835
These are definitely
gonna be game changers.

637
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,594
[Tinker] <i>This is step one.</i>

638
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,974
<i>This will become more commonplace</i>
<i>in my opinion.</i>

639
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,635
<i>Is this an important blip in time</i>
<i>in the history of shoes?</i>

640
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,846
<i>I'd say unquestionably.</i>

641
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,186
[explosion]

642
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,151
[heartbeat]

643
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,480
[crowd cheers and applauds]

644
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,652
[gentle guitar music playing]

645
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,659
[Tinker] <i>Before Bill passed away,</i>
<i>he wrote me a note.</i>

646
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,868
<i>The note went like this:</i>

647
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:19,919
<i>"Tinker Hatfield:</i>
<i>architect, shoe designer, track athlete,</i>

648
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,836
<i>husband and father.</i>

649
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:26,302
<i>This fulfills the obligations</i>
<i>of the University of Oregon.</i>

650
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,098
<i>Best regards, Bill Bowerman."</i>

651
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:39,025
I hope someday somebody will take my ashes
and just sprinkle them around the track.

652
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:43,528
Maybe a little bit on the pole vault pit,
and I'll be happy. [chuckles softly]

653
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:52,906
<i>I think if you just stay in your studio</i>
<i>and try and dream up new ideas,</i>

654
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,417
<i>there's not a good foundation</i>
<i>for your idea.</i>

655
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,509
<i>Just get out there and experience life.</i>

656
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,434
<i>That just gives you</i>
<i>the library in your head...</i>

657
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,890
[engine revs]

658
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,810
<i>to then translate that</i>
<i>into unique, new design work.</i>

659
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,180
[gentle guitar music continues]

660
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,895
<i>There are many designers out there</i>
<i>that are really great</i>

661
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,736
<i>at refining and interpreting</i>
<i>existing stuff</i>

662
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,202
<i>and moving the needle just a little bit.</i>

663
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:32,043
<i>And there's a fine art to that,</i>
<i>not overdoing it.</i>

664
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:39,205
<i>For me, though, my job as a provocateur...</i>

665
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:43,763
<i>that's all about</i>
<i>thinking further out into the future.</i>

666
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:57,098
<i>You have to look at</i>
<i>the landscape of the world</i>

667
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,686
<i>and go, "Okay,</i>
<i>I'm going to solve some problems.</i>

668
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,192
<i>I'm gonna add to some design features,</i>
<i>sort of mix it all together,</i>

669
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:06,396
<i>take a few risks, make a few assumptions</i>

670
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,157
<i>and just blend it all together."</i>

671
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,410
<i>That job does not go without its pitfalls.</i>

672
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:22,087
<i>But, if people don't either</i>
<i>love or hate your work,</i>

673
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,508
<i>you just haven't done all that much.</i>

674
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,017
