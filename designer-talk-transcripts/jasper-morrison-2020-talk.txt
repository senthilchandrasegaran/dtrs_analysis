00:17
thank you so 50 minutes I'm going to
00:24
stop there straight in this is one of my
00:28
first designs and as you can see I had
00:32
no idea what I was doing was it a
00:35
bicycle or a table yeah I'm still not
00:40
sure in any case it was a was a great
00:44
commercial success I sold I made them
00:47
for 20 pounds and I sold them for a
00:49
hundred and I sold 10 of them the next
00:58
next project was also a bit confused it
01:02
was half chair half table and the result
01:06
of long hours of sketching I had planned
01:12
to call it the drinking man's chair but
01:15
I went to a shop to buy some pipe
01:18
cleaners to make the model and the
01:22
packet was called the thinking man so
01:26
that's how it got its name that at that
01:32
time in my career I was very much into
01:34
imagining spaces imagining atmospheres
01:39
and the drawing on the left is is a kind
01:45
of visualization of the kind of room I
01:46
was imagining and I found that very
01:49
helpful in in working out what kind of
01:54
furniture to do that rug is called a rug
02:00
of many bosoms
02:02
and really it was a I'm not naturally a
02:09
very ornamental person but that was a
02:11
way of kind of getting to grips with
02:14
ornament and trying to find find reason
02:20
for ornament the next projects also a
02:26
bit confused part flowerpot part table
02:29
but these early experiments were ways of
02:33
without actually making anything of
02:35
using components which were
02:38
semi-industrial to get a result that
02:41
kind of mirrored the world of production
02:45
and I was supposed to be a hat stand
02:50
these three green bottles started life
02:56
as ordinary wine bottles actually and
03:00
the reason they used wine bottles was
03:02
was at the time in Berlin I couldn't
03:06
find any glassblowing
03:08
company and the best we could do was
03:11
just heat up the necks and fold sir
03:14
talks over but while doing it I realized
03:17
that actually the the wine bottles
03:19
themselves were very beautiful objects
03:20
and so it stands today as a sort of
03:24
homage to the the beauty of ordinary
03:27
things they were part of a of a room set
03:33
I was working on him in Berlin I had a
03:36
kind of three months project now and I
03:40
decided to make a room this was about
03:43
probably about the time of Memphis or a
03:45
bit after certainly it was a bit after
03:48
and it was really my reaction against
03:51
Memphis at that time I had the feeling
03:58
that Memphis and design in general was
04:01
was had sort of skipped a stage and was
04:05
designing things stripped straight for
04:08
museums and missing out the the actual
04:12
consumer so I wanted to get back to very
04:16
ordinary atmospheres and ordinary pieces
04:21
and one of the pieces was this chair
04:23
which really took its form and it's it's
04:27
material from the fact that I had to
04:30
make it myself
04:32
I'm not naturally a very gifted in the
04:35
craftsmanship category and side I really
04:41
decided just to to make it with a with
04:44
an electric jigsaw and to cut it out of
04:48
a flat sheet of plywood the only thing
04:53
being that the seat was a much thinner
04:55
sheet of plywood to provide a bit of
04:58
cushioning and I was intrigued by the
05:03
idea that you could turn this very
05:05
two-dimensional material into something
05:07
very three-dimensional another sketch
05:13
from from that project this was the kind
05:17
of atmosphere that I I found the most
05:21
convivial was a table two glasses of
05:25
bottled wine and two chairs and still
05:28
today it seems to me that that so many
05:31
designer restaurants are overdone over
05:34
over designed in a way and as designers
05:38
were quite often responsible for
05:40
designing away the atmosphere completely
05:45
that was the room itself built in a
05:49
gallery in Berlin this was my first
05:56
industrial project for a German company
06:00
called FSB and was a door handle that I
06:05
modeled on the left you see the model in
06:07
in plaster and that really gave me a lot
06:13
of assurance to actually have designed
06:16
something that was in production an
06:19
inspiration for it came from this
06:21
illustration out of a book of
06:27
components for for coaches and cars
06:30
early cars and this coach handle just
06:34
when I saw it seemed to me to have all
06:36
the characteristics of what a handle
06:39
should be so I literally took took
06:43
direct inspiration from that shape and
06:45
turned it into a modern door handle and
06:50
they don't object that went with it came
06:53
from a lightbulb so I think just to go
07:01
back to that one a lot of a lot of
07:03
inspiration I think can be found in very
07:06
very mundane places and mundane objects
07:11
and I you know in a strange way I had
07:14
already had by this time decided that I
07:17
didn't want to be a creator in the sense
07:21
of trying to draw shapes although I
07:23
still do a bit I prefer the attitude
07:26
that you can that we are kind of
07:28
reprocesses as as designers this
07:36
projects called
07:37
Atlas table and really was the result of
07:42
me not wearing my spectacles I was
07:46
sitting in a cafe one day and looked
07:49
looking across the room I saw a
07:50
beautiful table and putting on my
07:55
spectacles I saw that it was actually a
07:57
kind of optical effect of the shadow of
08:00
the tabletop making visible the whole of
08:04
the top part and then the Sun hitting
08:06
the the chrome bar lower down making it
08:09
look much thinner and so I had adapted
08:14
that shape and that's really another
08:19
another role of the design I think is to
08:22
be aware aware of aware enough to spot
08:25
these opportunities this later on came
08:29
to be a very big series of tables simply
08:35
by adjusting the length of the ledge of
08:38
the leg and choosing different tops
08:43
this was a first plastic project a very
08:48
simple idea of molding one half of a
08:54
product and using two of them to make
08:57
three-dimensional shape in this case
09:00
it's a bottle rack I put this photo in
09:06
it's a photo I took in India and to me
09:12
it just sums up what what design should
09:13
be about it's the leaf of the bigotry
09:17
protecting the younger tree and I put it
09:22
in to remind me to say that the design
09:25
is all about using materials to the to
09:27
their to their best used to the in the
09:29
most economic way and that's such a
09:36
beautiful example of using what you find
09:39
at hand this project was a bus stop for
09:46
the city of Hannover and we were all we
09:50
were asked as a group of designers and
09:54
architects to each do an individual bus
09:56
dock for the city and there were many
10:03
crazy shapes for bus stops being done
10:06
and mine was quite restrained as you can
10:11
see for the press event we all got in a
10:14
bus and we drove around all the
10:16
different bus stops stopping at each one
10:20
and the press would get off and have a
10:23
look and then we'd all get on the bus
10:24
and go back go to the next next stop
10:29
when we got to mine I had to press
10:32
people behind me say this one looks
10:35
really not normal let's stay on the bus
10:39
so I took that as a great compliment and
10:44
actually it got me I got me a job to
10:47
design the tram for Hannover which was a
10:50
hell of a big project took me three
10:54
years and really transformed our office
10:59
from a very sort of amateur outfit into
11:02
a more serious one allowed us to get a
11:06
decent decent sized office and although
11:14
politically it was a nightmare getting
11:16
the job done we had a lot of fun doing
11:19
the design taking the attitude really
11:22
just from the from personal experience
11:25
designing designing in a way that we
11:29
would like it to be as a passenger and I
11:33
think that's another very important
11:35
aspect of design is to not to forget
11:38
that we are ourselves consumers and that
11:40
we should be using these these objects
11:43
we design this is for rosenthal it's a
11:47
ceramic service now the plates have been
11:51
sawn in half just to show the shape and
11:58
here a project for a monastery designed
12:00
by local boozy I called latter ette and
12:04
you probably can't see it because it's a
12:07
very small image but that's in the top
12:09
left-hand corner of the right photo
12:12
there's a bench that was in the chapel
12:15
and I visited that the monastery before
12:20
I did the job and seeing those benches
12:24
they had such a kind of religious poise
12:27
to them that I decided to base the chair
12:30
for the refractory on that gesture of
12:33
the these kind of rails on the floor
12:35
which went out the back like a kind of
12:38
praying person
12:45
this is a project for Sonny
12:46
which never got made it was a kind of
12:52
tricky situation that we designed it for
12:54
Sonny Europe who were based in England
12:57
and there was a lot of infighting
13:01
between Sony Japan and Sony Europe at
13:03
that time and Sony Europe were not
13:06
considered good enough to have any
13:07
products made and so that the Japanese
13:12
Sony suppressed the project but I had in
13:16
my contract with him the right to
13:18
publish it and I did publish it you know
13:22
lay correctly labeled as a concept
13:24
project nevertheless people phoned up
13:27
Sony and asked them if they could buy it
13:29
and eventually I got a call from Sony
13:35
asking me to stop publishing it because
13:38
too many people were were asking to buy
13:40
it these two projects low pad and high
13:47
pad came about really from discovering a
13:53
process of pressing up foam which is
13:57
used in the car industry then I adapted
14:00
it to make a sort of new and slimline
14:06
upholstery I think taking away volume is
14:10
in upholstery as is always interesting
14:13
if you can do it without sacrificing too
14:16
much comfort another aspect of my work
14:22
is is occasional I'm not I wouldn't say
14:26
I'm a natural or I don't really enjoy it
14:30
even but occasionally I have to do
14:32
showrooms and in this case it's for
14:35
capellini in Milan
14:41
and the exhibition was called homework
14:45
and was during Salone Furniture Fair in
14:49
Milan I think we always have tried a
14:57
capellini I've worked for a couple in a
14:59
very long time now and we've always
15:02
tried to show the furniture in a more
15:04
real way rather than putting it on a
15:08
podium tried to make environments with
15:11
it these two images are collected from
15:22
another lecture I did about anonymous
15:24
objects and I put them in just to remind
15:27
me to talk about anonymous objects and
15:33
it's always struck me that anonymous
15:35
objects are very often better than than
15:37
designed objects which is okay of course
15:40
they are in most cases also designed but
15:44
why are they better when we're supposed
15:48
to be the professionals and I think the
15:51
answer is that the the motives behind
15:55
the design are actually better than our
15:57
motives they're not done to seek
16:01
publicity that's simply done to get the
16:05
job done to do a good job and it's
16:12
always it's always in the back of my
16:14
mind being a worry to me that that you
16:19
know how do we compete with this this
16:22
kind of fact that we are known designers
16:24
and and yet we can't design as well as
16:26
these these more humble invisible
16:30
designers and I think there's a great
16:34
deal to be learnt from them and we
16:37
should perhaps just just try and
16:39
question our motives for designing this
16:43
next project is called oppler and it's a
16:47
tray and a table the tray connects to
16:50
the table the idea being that you can
16:53
serve and
16:54
and take and then take the tray away
16:57
when you finished that was a beautifully
17:02
engineered project and I made by Alessi
17:05
in Italy and that's another another
17:10
point I'd like to make is that many of
17:12
these objects which which appear so
17:16
beautifully made beautifully designed
17:17
very often and the result of of an
17:19
engineer not just designer who who draws
17:24
every every detail but very much a
17:27
partnership between design and industry
17:30
industry knowing best how to make things
17:33
and designers perhaps having an
17:34
influence on on on various options
17:38
making choices but there's a lot of lot
17:42
of help that comes from in industry and
17:44
in good design
17:47
it's another Alessi project called tin
17:50
family just very simple spun stainless
17:55
steel shapes and a set of kitchen
18:00
utensils around about this time I
18:04
started start to get very interested in
18:07
in objects which are less less showy
18:12
less designed because at the same time
18:15
as I noticed anonymous design was good I
18:17
started to notice that that objects that
18:22
one wouldn't even put in a design
18:24
category objects that we use every day
18:27
were also also extremely effective not
18:32
just in in in use but in as sort of
18:36
companions in life they make very good
18:41
atmosphere and they do it without any
18:43
any kind of Big Show so I tried to to
18:47
learn from from these two two very
18:51
discreet sources of products what makes
18:54
a good object rather like like the
18:58
Vignelli share it's made in one piece it
19:01
takes three minutes to make and it's
19:06
quite strange to watch to watch
19:08
come out of the machine I should have
19:09
included an image of that that I
19:10
forgotten and that makes use of a
19:16
technology called gas injection which
19:19
means that you can hollow out just the
19:23
core of a plastic molding can be
19:25
hollowed out and filled with air under
19:27
pressure and that immediately freezes
19:32
the designer up from from the old world
19:36
plastic molding design where ribs were
19:41
necessary and a lot of very unpleasant
19:43
details so it makes for very smooth
19:47
fully fully rounded shapes and I was
19:51
lucky enough to be very early on on that
19:53
technology and this chair really really
19:57
grew out of the sample that I was given
19:59
which was a cylindrical section slightly
20:02
elliptical which was like a bone hollow
20:06
and on the inside and I designed the
20:09
chair literally from the leg up just
20:11
imagining if that was the leg of the
20:13
chair what would the rest of it look
20:15
like after that we did a series of other
20:20
projects other products in using the
20:22
same technology this folding chair which
20:27
unfortunately is less successful it
20:29
costs more because instead of one piece
20:32
it's three pieces and I think in general
20:37
there was less demand for folding chairs
20:39
than normal chairs I enjoy very much the
20:45
economy of ideas when when one idea can
20:48
lead to a whole series of products which
20:54
is either in in a sense of a system or
20:57
just in in terms of a family of
21:00
different models which which provide
21:02
different solutions or or which meet
21:05
different situations needs that's a
21:11
project for Vitra which is an office
21:13
desk system and
21:18
the idea being that that the so-called
21:21
third level the top level has these sort
21:24
of plug-in function functions or or hold
21:30
it for a light some little trays which
21:33
you can put loose things in or files
21:37
underneath the table on the right you
21:39
could see that the layout of the kind of
21:42
rubbery cable tray so you instead of
21:45
having to open a box or lift up the top
21:48
you just put in any adapters you need in
21:52
there and feed the wires through the
21:55
holes so that project was all about the
21:59
mystifying their office office desk
22:03
keeping all the functions but just
22:05
simplifying it so that it's not such a
22:07
scary machine and a second light for
22:12
floss called Lux master and this Paragon
22:17
Dini asked me to design an up lighter
22:19
which at that time was very sort of out
22:21
outdated kind of light I'm not sure why
22:26
it's outdated because I still think that
22:29
kind of light is almost the nicest when
22:32
it's bounced off the ceiling in any case
22:36
I came up with the big problem with a
22:38
with a moveable up lighter is always the
22:41
cable what to do with it and I had the
22:47
very simple idea just to make it like a
22:51
telephone wire and wrap it round the
22:54
support
22:58
was another show in in Tokyo for floss
23:04
and at that time I think I'd I designed
23:09
it in a very modest way and sent the
23:11
drawings off to to floss and the answer
23:14
came back that there was not in not
23:16
enough Global's in the window so I went
23:22
the other way and gave gave him a kind
23:23
of forest of Global's that you can see
23:30
maybe on the left behind the bench as yo
23:35
guns bench it was the same project in
23:37
Tokyo and again it was the situation
23:41
where lots of people were invited to
23:44
each design one bench for a street these
23:49
kind of international design projects
23:51
and the area in Tokyo is called Roppongi
23:55
Hills and had been a very very nice
23:57
local area eaten up by this by the giant
24:01
Laurie building corporation and it's of
24:09
this particular Street where the benches
24:11
are is a very glamorous shopping street
24:14
and on my quest for keeping some kind of
24:20
atmosphere I decided that what that
24:22
Street would need at the end was not not
24:26
a tense design a project but something
24:29
much more everyday or normal and I
24:33
settled on the idea of a sort of
24:34
extruded park bench and with some
24:42
satisfaction I whenever I pass it I see
24:44
people sitting there and eating lunch
24:45
and I think again we have to remember
24:48
that while as designers we we are
24:52
praised for being creative sometimes we
24:56
need to hold it in a bit and remember
25:01
that that things get used in the
25:03
atmosphere is not necessarily better
25:05
because we had a great creative urge
25:08
this sofa is called oblong
25:11
and it's held together by zips and it
25:16
really it came about because I was so
25:18
fed up with designing sofas for the mill
25:21
hand Furniture Fair which is a kind of I
25:24
don't know how many new sofas there are
25:26
every year in the bland Fair but they're
25:30
always perfect they're always
25:32
beautifully designed international style
25:37
sophisticated and glamorous and I
25:41
thought at that time that there must be
25:43
room for something more ugly and I think
25:48
I heard a few speakers talking about
25:50
ugliness and I think that's that's a
25:53
growing theme in design why are we all
25:56
struggling to make everything so
25:57
beautiful does it is that really is that
26:00
really beauty sometimes beauty can come
26:03
from from in other ways so it's it's a
26:11
kind of module you can zip it together
26:14
as long as you want could be an arm
26:16
chair or it could be a 10 seater and it
26:20
can go around the corners to that
26:25
project the chair on the right is
26:28
actually the air chair inside and it's
26:31
been covered with leather and stitched
26:33
and that was a project I did with
26:35
capellini and the idea really was just
26:41
to transform our chair from a 50/50 euro
26:44
chair 50 pound 60 euros on the
26:47
Enlightenment into a very high-class
26:50
object and to give it another completely
26:55
other life and that's a kind of economy
26:58
which for me is very much part of design
27:01
I think it's not just with materials
27:04
that we have to be economic but also
27:06
with ideas and very very often the most
27:10
pleasing designs are the ones with where
27:12
where the thought has been eaten most
27:16
easily arrived at this is a project
27:21
which hello's involved into this is the
27:23
Vitra home project
27:24
and on the left as various people's work
27:28
Burrell acts and mine
27:32
I did these quark quark tables for them
27:36
and which everyone calls stools for some
27:42
reason but the idea was that there were
27:44
little side tables and I read an article
27:48
that the cork forests in Spain was
27:52
suffering from a kind of disease which
27:54
meant that they didn't make very good
27:57
wine corks anymore they tended to make
28:01
the wine go off and so the cork trade
28:04
was in a very bad shape and it's such a
28:10
beautiful material and it seemed
28:14
appropriate to try and find a use for it
28:20
that's a chair also from the Vitra
28:23
project it's using a kind of elastic
28:25
netting again the idea of reduce
28:29
reducing the volume of upholstery and a
28:32
table with a cast cast leg in the
28:36
corners and and spaced out by square
28:39
tube allowing all kinds of different
28:43
proportions of table and at a marble top
28:52
this project was my biggest biggest
28:56
disaster it was done for a French
28:59
company called Rowenta
29:01
and it was on our first product is a
29:03
serious product design job and we put
29:08
everything into it it took us three
29:10
years to finish it and we were really
29:15
counting on it because we hope to get
29:17
more work in that direction and I think
29:22
we did a reasonable job this is an
29:25
electric kettle and unfortunately it
29:29
didn't work it wouldn't switch off and
29:33
water came out the base they couldn't
29:37
get it to seal properly and I started to
29:40
get letters from from people in America
29:43
telling me that I'd ruined their
29:45
kitchens and that's I can tell you with
29:49
the Internet these days you you are very
29:51
much available for comment if somebody
29:55
doesn't like your your product so we
29:59
still receive a lot of a lot of
30:00
complaints about these and that was a
30:04
painful lesson that you should I don't
30:07
know why it happened I mean normally
30:09
they make kettles that work but you you
30:14
better choose your your manufacturer as
30:16
well it's maybe it's what Massimo said
30:19
about about choosing good glance the
30:24
coffee maker the coffee ran everywhere
30:29
except in into the jug
30:34
on the right you can see the idea that
30:38
the lid lifts up and you can keep the
30:39
filters in there and and a spoon and a
30:45
toaster that has a motorized up and up
30:50
and down function which doesn't work
30:57
so back to safer products
31:00
this one's called called trash and it's
31:04
for majus small company north of Venice
31:07
and just a very simple idea of trying to
31:12
find a way that you don't have the
31:13
plastic bag hanging out of the basket
31:15
all the time you can buy it with or
31:18
without the lid and the lid comes with
31:20
this this ring you can see in the right
31:22
photo which you wrapped the background
31:29
that's a project for Samsung again never
31:33
got made we haven't had much luck with
31:37
our product design yet in fact they did
31:42
a version of the one on the right to the
31:45
uppermost right hand one in America but
31:48
it was so so much changed that that it
31:51
was hardly recognizable that's a newish
31:57
project for capellini using the same old
31:59
system as low pad and high pad but to
32:02
create a proper reading chair and
32:07
although low pad I was always very
32:10
pleased with the with the shape of low
32:13
pad with the look of it it was never
32:16
that comfortable and in fact I know I
32:18
have one in my house and very rarely sit
32:21
in it so I wanted to try and do a chair
32:25
that I really would use and I thought it
32:29
should be a reading chance this was the
32:31
result it tilts the headrest is held on
32:34
by magnets so you can turn it around or
32:38
you can move it up and down it's a free
32:41
free agent
32:49
that's project for a lessee
32:51
pots and pans and very serious project
32:56
actually we did in a very short time and
32:59
that's always good
33:00
I think projects would show again this
33:05
is kind of this sense of a family of
33:07
objects is is always very pleasing to do
33:10
because you have one idea and you make a
33:12
lot of products and there's a kind of
33:16
efficiency to it the main feature I
33:20
suppose is the lid I don't know if you
33:22
can see on the left picture it's got a
33:25
kind of try-try handle which means that
33:30
you can pick it up with a wooden spoon
33:32
and turn it over and it's much more
33:34
usable and when it when it when you do
33:37
turn it over and put it on the kitchen
33:38
top it's it's it's straight it doesn't
33:42
fall off that on the right I'll just go
33:47
back
33:49
that's another LSE project called a
33:52
knife fork spoon and this was really the
33:55
first time that I I tried to do
33:58
something so normal as this it took us
34:01
five years to do it and it's incredible
34:06
how if you will use a fork every day a
34:09
few times a day and if you try and draw
34:13
a fork or try to try to just sketch a
34:15
fork you'd be amazed how difficult it is
34:18
and so actually getting to know what a
34:20
what a good Fork is is what took most of
34:24
the time we kept doing drawings
34:26
confidently thinking that we designed a
34:28
beautiful Fork and we got back
34:31
prototypes which were just horrible and
34:34
it really I think we did five separate
34:37
prototypes until we got to this this
34:40
result which is it's pretty fork fork
34:43
knife and spoon like I really was
34:47
getting more and more interested in in
34:49
this kind of design maybe that wasn't
34:51
anymore going to try and try and
34:53
surprise anybody but which would be
34:55
really enjoyable to live with
34:58
because it seemed to me looking around
35:00
my house that my favorite objects were
35:02
we're not so much the sensational ones
35:06
but the the more discrete ones and in
35:09
some cases I'd been using them for many
35:11
years before realizing how fantastic
35:14
there were so things like a chopping
35:17
board for example with a slightly curved
35:20
edge on on the on off all sides so that
35:25
it's easier to pick up and when you wash
35:28
it you lean it against the top and the
35:30
wood grain doesn't pick up the doesn't
35:33
pick up the water because there's such a
35:35
small point area of contact so noticing
35:40
things like that after using them for
35:42
several years I started to realize that
35:45
objects it's an incredibly sophisticated
35:48
world and sometimes our attempts as
35:53
designers are really laughable beside
35:55
beside the evolution of certain objects
36:00
many objects look like they look in many
36:04
normal objects look like they look
36:06
because they've been refined over years
36:08
to do to do their job and so this this
36:12
project was really a first attempt at
36:16
doing something much more normal and I
36:21
really I was really worried about it
36:23
because I just thought it would would be
36:25
it would go unnoticed and it wouldn't be
36:28
it would probably not be bought but it
36:33
was bought and it's very successful and
36:37
I think that that gave me a lot of
36:39
confidence to to pursue this idea and I
36:43
was in the Milan fair and I saw a stool
36:46
by a Japanese designer called natto
36:49
Fukuzawa who you probably all know and
36:53
um it seemed to me that that was very
36:57
much to say and trying to do the same
36:59
kind of thing and later that day I was
37:03
talking to a guy from muji and I
37:07
mentioned these two projects
37:10
and he said super normal and so super
37:14
when the minute he said super normal to
37:16
me that that really that was it
37:18
that was the name for for these kind of
37:20
projects and I in conversation with NATO
37:24
we we came up with the idea of trying to
37:27
we discuss what is super normal what
37:29
does it mean we came up with the idea of
37:32
trying to find out what it meant by
37:34
making an exhibition and the first
37:38
exhibition was held in Tokyo about a
37:43
year ago I think now and we showed it
37:46
again in London and we will show it in
37:49
Milan that the during the furniture fair
37:52
in April at the tree an alley and
37:56
supernormal is a collection of objects
37:59
which which have this characteristic of
38:01
being normal but somehow more than
38:05
normal
38:06
and I think we learnt slowly that in in
38:12
many ways super normal objects you can't
38:16
really design them they become super
38:18
normal through through use almost and so
38:24
we collected together 200 objects and we
38:26
could have collected thousands more some
38:29
of them are by designers some of them
38:30
are anonymous and some of them are
38:34
incredibly familiar you can see those
38:36
scissors with the orange hand orange
38:39
handle so it's all about it's about
38:42
familiarity and objects which we use
38:45
without without consideration even but
38:49
they're they are part of our life and
38:51
they make an atmosphere without making a
38:56
fuss about it I think the the kind of
39:02
explosion of media interest in design
39:04
recently has is having a very negative
39:08
effect on on the design world itself I
39:12
think many designers are many younger
39:17
designers seeing this this kind of media
39:20
celebration of design
39:22
are convinced in a sense that that what
39:26
they see in the magazines is design I
39:29
think on the other hand the media are
39:31
just interested in selling magazines so
39:35
the more sensational der the product is
39:38
the more likely they are to put it on
39:40
the cover or make a big fuss about it
39:42
and I think it's having a very
39:46
distorting effect on design and it's
39:51
quite understandable that as a young
39:53
designer you need to get known you need
39:55
to have your works Eden but I think we
39:58
need to remember that as designers we
40:00
are responsible for our environment and
40:06
filling it with with amazing shapes and
40:12
forms and surprising expressions of our
40:16
genius doesn't make a very good
40:19
atmosphere and in fact is to me is
40:24
becoming a kind of visual pollution so
40:28
supernormal really the idea of the
40:31
exhibition is to make a discussion about
40:35
it - as a sort of gentle reminder that
40:38
that the motivations of design are quite
40:44
important and good objects don't always
40:46
come from just wanting to to be noticed
40:49
so I hope if any of you go to Milan
40:55
you'll you'll be able to see that so
40:59
more views the ladder actually wasn't
41:01
chosen but I think we should get one
41:12
so that's just some examples of the kind
41:14
of objects which which we chose so the
41:19
super normal objects can also be objects
41:21
which which we're just so used to that
41:23
we barely notice now I like the Bialetti
41:25
coffee machine or the glass in front of
41:28
it we might have used hundreds of times
41:31
without even thinking about it but if
41:33
you actually look at it you realize that
41:36
it is actually an incredibly effective
41:38
and beautiful object so this is our last
41:46
picture and this project was a couple of
41:49
years ago in Milan and it's called the
41:52
crate and it came about I had it in my
41:56
apartment I just moved in and there
41:58
wasn't much furniture there and I
42:01
adapted a wine crate which looks exactly
42:04
like this as a bedside table when I
42:09
started to use it and found that I could
42:11
stack up some books in the bottom of it
42:13
and it just for me it was perfect the
42:18
perfect solution for a bedside table and
42:21
so I made it in all innocence thinking
42:24
that that it was a nice offering and it
42:28
caused a huge amount of trouble actually
42:31
people complained about it and was
42:36
saying that my motivations were were
42:38
cynical and and I can't remember what
42:43
else the problem was for them I don't
42:46
know how that sort of struck a note with
42:49
me that there's something very wrong
42:50
with the design world at the moment if
42:53
you can't do a simple product like the
42:56
crate without being criticized but
42:59
anyway that's not a very good note to
43:01
end with but now
43:04
thank you
